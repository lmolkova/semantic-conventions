- key: app.installation.id
  type: string
  examples:
  - 2ab2916d-a51f-4ac8-80ee-45ac31a28092
  brief: |
    A unique identifier representing the installation of an application on a specific device
  note: |
    Its value SHOULD persist across launches of the same application installation, including through application upgrades.
    It SHOULD change if the application is uninstalled or if all applications of the vendor are uninstalled.
    Additionally, users might be able to reset this value (e.g. by clearing application data).
    If an app is installed multiple times on the same device (e.g. in different accounts on Android), each `app.installation.id` SHOULD have a different value.
    If multiple OpenTelemetry SDKs are used within the same application, they SHOULD use the same value for `app.installation.id`.
    Hardware IDs (e.g. serial number, IMEI, MAC address) MUST NOT be used as the `app.installation.id`.

    For iOS, this value SHOULD be equal to the [vendor identifier](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidevice/identifierforvendor).

    For Android, examples of `app.installation.id` implementations include:

    - [Firebase Installation ID](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/manage-installations).
    - A globally unique UUID which is persisted across sessions in your application.
    - [App set ID](https://developer.android.com/identity/app-set-id).
    - [`Settings.getString(Settings.Secure.ANDROID_ID)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Settings.Secure#ANDROID_ID).

  brief: |
    The full [hash value (see glossary)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.186-5.pdf), often found in checksum.txt on a release of the artifact and used to verify package integrity.
  note: |
    The specific algorithm used to create the cryptographic hash value is
    not defined. In situations where an artifact has multiple
    cryptographic hashes, it is up to the implementer to choose which
    hash value to set here; this should be the most secure hash algorithm
    that is suitable for the situation and consistent with the
    corresponding attestation. The implementer can then provide the other
    hash values through an additional set of attribute extensions as they
    deem necessary.

  note: |
    This value is intended to be taken from the [UA client hints API](https://wicg.github.io/ua-client-hints/#interface) (`navigator.userAgentData.platform`). If unavailable, the legacy `navigator.platform` API SHOULD NOT be used instead and this attribute SHOULD be left unset in order for the values to be consistent.
    The list of possible values is defined in the [W3C User-Agent Client Hints specification](https://wicg.github.io/ua-client-hints/#sec-ch-ua-platform). Note that some (but not all) of these values can overlap with values in the [`os.type` and `os.name` attributes](./os.md). However, for consistency, the values in the `browser.platform` attribute should capture the exact value that the user agent provides.

    Cloud provider-specific native identifier of the monitored cloud resource (e.g. an [ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) on AWS, a [fully qualified resource ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/resources/resources/get-by-id) on Azure, a [full resource name](https://google.aip.dev/122#full-resource-names) on GCP)
  note: |
    On some cloud providers, it may not be possible to determine the full ID at startup,
    so it may be necessary to set `cloud.resource_id` as a span attribute instead.

    The exact value to use for `cloud.resource_id` depends on the cloud provider.
    The following well-known definitions MUST be used if you set this attribute and they apply:

    - **AWS Lambda:** The function [ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html).
      Take care not to use the "invoked ARN" directly but replace any
      [alias suffix](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-aliases.html)
      with the resolved function version, as the same runtime instance may be invocable with
      multiple different aliases.
    - **GCP:** The [URI of the resource](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/full-resource-names)
    - **Azure:** The [Fully Qualified Resource ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/resources/resources/get-by-id) of the invoked function,
      *not* the function app, having the form
      `/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_GUID>/resourceGroups/<RG>/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/<FUNCAPP>/functions/<FUNC>`.
      This means that a span attribute MUST be used, as an Azure function app can host multiple functions that would usually share
      a TracerProvider.

    The name of the connection pool; unique within the instrumented application. In case the connection pool implementation doesn't provide a name, instrumentation SHOULD use a combination of parameters that would make the name unique, for example, combining attributes `server.address`, `server.port`, and `db.namespace`, formatted as `server.address:server.port/db.namespace`. Instrumentations that generate connection pool name following different patterns SHOULD document it.

  brief: |

    It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application

    The operation name SHOULD NOT be extracted from `db.query.text`,
    when the database system supports query text with multiple operations
    in non-batch operations.

    If spaces can occur in the operation name, multiple consecutive spaces
    SHOULD be normalized to a single space.

    For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same operation name
    then that operation name SHOULD be used prepended by `BATCH `,
    otherwise `db.operation.name` SHOULD be `BATCH` or some other database
    system specific term if more applicable.

  note: |
    For example, a client-side maximum number of rows to read from the database
    MAY be recorded as the `db.operation.parameter.max_rows` attribute.

    `db.query.text` parameters SHOULD be captured using `db.query.parameter.<key>`
    instead of `db.operation.parameter.<key>`.
  stability: development
- key: db.query.parameter
  type: template[string]
  examples:
  - someval
  - '55'
  brief: |
    A database query parameter, with `<key>` being the parameter name, and the attribute value being a string representation of the parameter value.
  note: |
    If a query parameter has no name and instead is referenced only by index,
    then `<key>` SHOULD be the 0-based index.

    `db.query.parameter.<key>` SHOULD match
    up with the parameterized placeholders present in `db.query.text`.

    It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application
    without attempting to do any case normalization.

    `db.query.parameter.<key>` SHOULD NOT be captured on batch operations.

    Examples:

    - For a query `SELECT * FROM users where username =  %s` with the parameter `"jdoe"`,
      the attribute `db.query.parameter.0` SHOULD be set to `"jdoe"`.

    - For a query `"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %(userName)s;` with parameter
      `userName = "jdoe"`, the attribute `db.query.parameter.userName` SHOULD be set to `"jdoe"`.

  type: string

  brief: |
    Low cardinality summary of a database query.
  note: |
    The query summary describes a class of database queries and is useful
    as a grouping key, especially when analyzing telemetry for database
    calls involving complex queries.

    Summary may be available to the instrumentation through
    instrumentation hooks or other means. If it is not available, instrumentations
    that support query parsing SHOULD generate a summary following
    [Generating query summary](/docs/db/database-spans.md#generating-a-summary-of-the-query)
    section.
  stability: stable
- key: db.query.text
  type: string
  examples:
  - SELECT * FROM wuser_table where username = ?

  brief: |
    The database query being executed.
  note: |
    For sanitization see [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](/docs/db/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).
    For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same query text then that query text SHOULD be used, otherwise all of the individual query texts SHOULD be concatenated with separator `; ` or some other database system specific separator if more applicable.
    Parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be sanitized. Even though parameterized query text can potentially have sensitive data, by using a parameterized query the user is giving a strong signal that any sensitive data will be passed as parameter values, and the benefit to observability of capturing the static part of the query text by default outweighs the risk.

  examples:
  - timeout
  - java.net.UnknownHostException
  - server_certificate_invalid
  - '500'
  brief: |
    Describes a class of error the operation ended with.
  note: |
    The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

    When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
    canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

    Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

    The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
    Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
    should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
    additional filters are applied.

    If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

    If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
    it's RECOMMENDED to:

    - Use a domain-specific attribute
    - Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

  note: |
    This is the name of the function as configured/deployed on the FaaS
    platform and is usually different from the name of the callback
    function (which may be stored in the
    [`code.namespace`/`code.function.name`](/docs/general/attributes.md#source-code-attributes)
    span attributes).

    For some cloud providers, the above definition is ambiguous. The following
    definition of function name MUST be used for this attribute
    (and consequently the span name) for the listed cloud providers/products:

    - **Azure:**  The full name `<FUNCAPP>/<FUNC>`, i.e., function app name
      followed by a forward slash followed by the function name (this form
      can also be seen in the resource JSON for the function).
      This means that a span attribute MUST be used, as an Azure function
      app can host multiple functions that would usually share
      a TracerProvider (see also the `cloud.resource_id` attribute).

  brief: The evaluated value of the feature flag.
  note: |
    With some feature flag providers, feature flag results can be quite large or contain private or sensitive details.
    Because of this, `feature_flag.result.variant` is often the preferred attribute if it is available.

    It may be desirable to redact or otherwise limit the size and scope of `feature_flag.result.value` if possible.
    Because the evaluated flag value is unstructured and may be any type, it is left to the instrumentation author to determine how best to achieve this.

  brief: |
    A semantic identifier for an evaluated flag value.
  note: |-
    A semantic identifier, commonly referred to as a variant, provides a means
    for referring to a value without including the value itself. This can
    provide additional context for understanding the meaning behind a value.
    For example, the variant `red` maybe be used for the value `#c05543`.

- key: file.fork_name
  type: string
  examples:
  - Zone.Identifier
  brief: |
    Name of the fork. A fork is additional data associated with a filesystem object.
  note: |
    On Linux, a resource fork is used to store additional data with a filesystem object. A file always has at least one fork for the data portion, and additional forks may exist.
    On NTFS, this is analogous to an Alternate Data Stream (ADS), and the default data stream for a file is just called $DATA. Zone.Identifier is commonly used by Windows to track contents downloaded from the Internet. An ADS is typically of the form: C:\path\to\filename.extension:some_fork_name, and some_fork_name is the value that should populate `fork_name`. `filename.extension` should populate `file.name`, and `extension` should populate `file.extension`. The full path, `file.path`, will include the fork name.

  note: |
    Data sources are used by AI agents and RAG applications to store grounding data. A data source may be an external database, object store, document collection, website, or any other storage system used by the GenAI agent or application. The `gen_ai.data_source.id` SHOULD match the identifier used by the GenAI system rather than a name specific to the external storage, such as a database or object store. Semantic conventions referencing `gen_ai.data_source.id` MAY also leverage additional attributes, such as `db.*`, to further identify and describe the data source.

    This attribute provides a human-readable interpretation of the evaluation score produced by an evaluator. For example, a score value of 1 could mean "relevant" in one evaluation system and "not relevant" in another, depending on the scoring range and evaluator. The label SHOULD have low cardinality. Possible values depend on the evaluation metric and evaluator used; implementations SHOULD document the possible values.

  brief: The Generative AI provider as identified by the client or server instrumentation.
  note: |
    The attribute SHOULD be set based on the instrumentation's best
    knowledge and may differ from the actual model provider.

    Multiple providers, including Azure OpenAI, Gemini, and AI hosting platforms
    are accessible using the OpenAI REST API and corresponding client libraries,
    but may proxy or host models from different providers.

    The `gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.response.model`, and `server.address`
    attributes may help identify the actual system in use.

    The `gen_ai.provider.name` attribute acts as a discriminator that
    identifies the GenAI telemetry format flavor specific to that provider
    within GenAI semantic conventions.
    It SHOULD be set consistently with provider-specific attributes and signals.
    For example, GenAI spans, metrics, and events related to AWS Bedrock
    should have the `gen_ai.provider.name` set to `aws.bedrock` and include
    applicable `aws.bedrock.*` attributes and are not expected to include
    `openai.*` attributes.

    HTTP request headers, `<key>` being the normalized HTTP Header name (lowercase), the value being the header values.
  note: |
    Instrumentations SHOULD require an explicit configuration of which headers are to be captured.
    Including all request headers can be a security risk - explicit configuration helps avoid leaking sensitive information.

    The `User-Agent` header is already captured in the `user_agent.original` attribute.
    Users MAY explicitly configure instrumentations to capture them even though it is not recommended.

    The attribute value MUST consist of either multiple header values as an array of strings
    or a single-item array containing a possibly comma-concatenated string, depending on the way
    the HTTP library provides access to headers.

    Examples:

    - A header `Content-Type: application/json` SHOULD be recorded as the `http.request.header.content-type`
      attribute with value `["application/json"]`.
    - A header `X-Forwarded-For: 1.2.3.4, 1.2.3.5` SHOULD be recorded as the `http.request.header.x-forwarded-for`

  note: |
    HTTP request method value SHOULD be "known" to the instrumentation.
    By default, this convention defines "known" methods as the ones listed in [RFC9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-methods),
    the PATCH method defined in [RFC5789](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789.html)
    and the QUERY method defined in [httpbis-safe-method-w-body](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpbis-safe-method-w-body/?include_text=1).

    If the HTTP request method is not known to instrumentation, it MUST set the `http.request.method` attribute to `_OTHER`.

    If the HTTP instrumentation could end up converting valid HTTP request methods to `_OTHER`, then it MUST provide a way to override
    the list of known HTTP methods. If this override is done via environment variable, then the environment variable MUST be named
    OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_HTTP_KNOWN_METHODS and support a comma-separated list of case-sensitive known HTTP methods
    (this list MUST be a full override of the default known method, it is not a list of known methods in addition to the defaults).

    HTTP method names are case-sensitive and `http.request.method` attribute value MUST match a known HTTP method name exactly.
    Instrumentations for specific web frameworks that consider HTTP methods to be case insensitive, SHOULD populate a canonical equivalent.
    Tracing instrumentations that do so, MUST also set `http.request.method_original` to the original value.

  brief: |
    The matched route template for the request. This MUST be low-cardinality and include all static path segments, with dynamic path segments represented with placeholders.
  note: |
    MUST NOT be populated when this is not supported by the HTTP server framework as the route attribute should have low-cardinality and the URI path can NOT substitute it.
    SHOULD include the [application root](/docs/http/http-spans.md#http-server-definitions) if there is one.

    A static path segment is a part of the route template with a fixed, low-cardinality value. This includes literal strings like `/users/` and placeholders that
    are constrained to a finite, predefined set of values, e.g. `{controller}` or `{action}`.

    A dynamic path segment is a placeholder for a value that can have high cardinality and is not constrained to a predefined list like static path segments.

    Instrumentations SHOULD use routing information provided by the corresponding web framework. They SHOULD pick the most precise source of routing information and MAY
    support custom route formatting. Instrumentations SHOULD document the format and the API used to obtain the route string.

  examples:
  - 218fc5a9-a5f1-4b54-aa05-46717d0ab26d
  brief: |
    A pseudo-ID for the cluster, set to the UID of the `kube-system` namespace.
  note: |
    K8s doesn't have support for obtaining a cluster ID. If this is ever
    added, we will recommend collecting the `k8s.cluster.uid` through the
    official APIs. In the meantime, we are able to use the `uid` of the
    `kube-system` namespace as a proxy for cluster ID. Read on for the
    rationale.

    Every object created in a K8s cluster is assigned a distinct UID. The
    `kube-system` namespace is used by Kubernetes itself and will exist
    for the lifetime of the cluster. Using the `uid` of the `kube-system`
    namespace is a reasonable proxy for the K8s ClusterID as it will only
    change if the cluster is rebuilt. Furthermore, Kubernetes UIDs are
    UUIDs as standardized by
    [ISO/IEC 9834-8 and ITU-T X.667](https://www.itu.int/ITU-T/studygroups/com17/oid.html).
    Which states:

    > If generated according to one of the mechanisms defined in Rec.
    > ITU-T X.667 | ISO/IEC 9834-8, a UUID is either guaranteed to be
    > different from all other UUIDs generated before 3603 A.D., or is
    > extremely likely to be different (depending on the mechanism chosen).

    Therefore, UIDs between clusters should be extremely unlikely to
    conflict.

  examples:
  - otlp_grpc_span_exporter/0
  - custom-name
  brief: |
    A name uniquely identifying the instance of the OpenTelemetry component within its containing SDK instance.
  note: |
    Implementations SHOULD ensure a low cardinality for this attribute, even across application or SDK restarts.
    E.g. implementations MUST NOT use UUIDs as values for this attribute.

    Implementations MAY achieve these goals by following a `<otel.component.type>/<instance-counter>` pattern, e.g. `batching_span_processor/0`.
    Hereby `otel.component.type` refers to the corresponding attribute value of the component.

    The value of `instance-counter` MAY be automatically assigned by the component and uniqueness within the enclosing SDK instance MUST be guaranteed.
    For example, `<instance-counter>` MAY be implemented by using a monotonically increasing counter (starting with `0`), which is incremented every time an
    instance of the given component type is started.

    With this implementation, for example the first Batching Span Processor would have `batching_span_processor/0`
    as `otel.component.name`, the second one `batching_span_processor/1` and so on.
    These values will therefore be reused in the case of an application restart.

- key: service.instance.id

  examples:
  - 627cc493-f310-47de-96bd-71410b7dec09
  brief: |
    The string ID of the service instance.
  note: |
    MUST be unique for each instance of the same `service.namespace,service.name` pair (in other words
    `service.namespace,service.name,service.instance.id` triplet MUST be globally unique). The ID helps to
    distinguish instances of the same service that exist at the same time (e.g. instances of a horizontally scaled
    service).

    Implementations, such as SDKs, are recommended to generate a random Version 1 or Version 4 [RFC
    4122](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt) UUID, but are free to use an inherent unique ID as the source of
    this value if stability is desirable. In that case, the ID SHOULD be used as source of a UUID Version 5 and
    SHOULD use the following UUID as the namespace: `4d63009a-8d0f-11ee-aad7-4c796ed8e320`.

    UUIDs are typically recommended, as only an opaque value for the purposes of identifying a service instance is
    needed. Similar to what can be seen in the man page for the
    [`/etc/machine-id`](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/machine-id.html) file, the underlying
    data, such as pod name and namespace should be treated as confidential, being the user's choice to expose it
    or not via another resource attribute.

    For applications running behind an application server (like unicorn), we do not recommend using one identifier
    for all processes participating in the application. Instead, it's recommended each division (e.g. a worker
    thread in unicorn) to have its own instance.id.

    It's not recommended for a Collector to set `service.instance.id` if it can't unambiguously determine the
    service instance that is generating that telemetry. For instance, creating an UUID based on `pod.name` will
    likely be wrong, as the Collector might not know from which container within that pod the telemetry originated.
    However, Collectors can set the `service.instance.id` if they can unambiguously determine the service instance
    for that telemetry. This is typically the case for scraping receivers, as they know the target address and
    port.

  examples:

  brief: |
    Logical name of the service.
  note: |
    MUST be the same for all instances of horizontally scaled services. If the value was not specified, SDKs MUST fallback to `unknown_service:` concatenated with [`process.executable.name`](process.md), e.g. `unknown_service:bash`. If `process.executable.name` is not available, the value MUST be set to `unknown_service`.

  note: |

If `service.namespace` is not specified in the Resource then `service.name` is expected to be unique for all services that have no explicit namespace defined (so the empty/unspecified namespace is simply one more valid namespace). Zero-length namespace string is assumed equal to unspecified namespace.

  note: |
    This attribute MAY be derived from the contents of the `user_agent.original` attribute. Components that populate the attribute are responsible for determining what they consider to be synthetic bot or test traffic. This attribute can either be set for self-identification purposes, or on telemetry detected to be generated as a result of a synthetic request. This attribute is useful for distinguishing between genuine client traffic and synthetic traffic generated by bots or tests.

    [Example](https://uaparser.dev/#demo) of extracting browser's version from original string. In the case of using a user-agent for non-browser products, such as microservices with multiple names/versions inside the `user_agent.original`, the most significant version SHOULD be selected. In such a scenario it should align with `user_agent.name`

      note: |
        MUST NOT be populated when this is not supported by the HTTP server framework as the route attribute should have low-cardinality and the URI path can NOT substitute it.
        SHOULD include the [application root](/docs/http/http-spans.md#http-server-definitions) if there is one.

        A static path segment is a part of the route template with a fixed, low-cardinality value. This includes literal strings like `/users/` and placeholders that
        are constrained to a finite, predefined set of values, e.g. `{controller}` or `{action}`.

        A dynamic path segment is a placeholder for a value that can have high cardinality and is not constrained to a predefined list like static path segments.

        Instrumentations SHOULD use routing information provided by the corresponding web framework. They SHOULD pick the most precise source of routing information and MAY
        support custom route formatting. Instrumentations SHOULD document the format and the API used to obtain the route string.

      There might be errors in a pipeline run that are non fatal (eg. they are suppressed) or in a parallel stage multiple stages could have a fatal error.
      This means that this error count might not be the same as the count of metric `cicd.pipeline.run.duration` with run result `failure`.

      brief: |
        Describes a class of error the operation ended with.
      note: |
        The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

        When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
        canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

        Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

        The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
        Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
        should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
        additional filters are applied.

        If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

        If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
        it's RECOMMENDED to:

        - Use a domain-specific attribute
        - Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

Even though parameterized query text can potentially have sensitive data, by using a parameterized query the user is giving a strong signal that any sensitive data will be passed as parameter values, and the benefit to observability of capturing the static part of the query text by default outweighs the risk.

        Low cardinality summary of a database query.
      note: |
        The query summary describes a class of database queries and is useful
        as a grouping key, especially when analyzing telemetry for database
        calls involving complex queries.

        Summary may be available to the instrumentation through
        instrumentation hooks or other means. If it is not available, instrumentations
        that support query parsing SHOULD generate a summary following
        [Generating query summary](/docs/db/database-spans.md#generating-a-summary-of-the-query)
        section.

      brief: The name of a collection (table, container) within the database.
      note: |
        It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application
        without attempting to do any case normalization.

        The collection name SHOULD NOT be extracted from `db.query.text`,
        when the database system supports query text with multiple collections
        in non-batch operations.

        For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same
        collection name then that collection name SHOULD be used.

      note: |
        It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application
        without attempting to do any case normalization.

        The operation name SHOULD NOT be extracted from `db.query.text`,
        when the database system supports query text with multiple operations
        in non-batch operations.

        If spaces can occur in the operation name, multiple consecutive spaces
        SHOULD be normalized to a single space.

        For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same operation name
        then that operation name SHOULD be used prepended by `BATCH `,
        otherwise `db.operation.name` SHOULD be `BATCH` or some other database
        system specific term if more applicable.

      brief: Peer address of the database node where the operation was performed.
      note: |
        Semantic conventions for individual database systems SHOULD document whether `network.peer.*` attributes are applicable. Network peer address and port are useful when the application interacts with individual database nodes directly.
        If a database operation involved multiple network calls (for example retries), the address of the last contacted node SHOULD be used.

      note: |
        If a database system has multiple namespace components, they SHOULD be concatenated from the most general to the most specific namespace component, using `|` as a separator between the components. Any missing components (and their associated separators) SHOULD be omitted.
        Semantic conventions for individual database systems SHOULD document what `db.namespace` means in the context of that system.
        It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application without attempting to do any case normalization.

        The database query being executed.
      note: |
        For sanitization see [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](/docs/db/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).
        For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same query text then that query text SHOULD be used, otherwise all of the individual query texts SHOULD be concatenated with separator `; ` or some other database system specific separator if more applicable.
        Parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be sanitized. Even though parameterized query text can potentially have sensitive data, by using a parameterized query the user is giving a strong signal that any sensitive data will be passed as parameter values, and the benefit to observability of capturing the static part of the query text by default outweighs the risk.

      note: |
        The attribute SHOULD be set based on the instrumentation's best
        knowledge and may differ from the actual model provider.

        Multiple providers, including Azure OpenAI, Gemini, and AI hosting platforms
        are accessible using the OpenAI REST API and corresponding client libraries,
        but may proxy or host models from different providers.

        The `gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.response.model`, and `server.address`
        attributes may help identify the actual system in use.

        The `gen_ai.provider.name` attribute acts as a discriminator that
        identifies the GenAI telemetry format flavor specific to that provider
        within GenAI semantic conventions.
        It SHOULD be set consistently with provider-specific attributes and signals.
        For example, GenAI spans, metrics, and events related to AWS Bedrock
        should have the `gen_ai.provider.name` set to `aws.bedrock` and include
        applicable `aws.bedrock.*` attributes and are not expected to include

      brief: The Generative AI provider as identified by the client or server instrumentation.
      note: |
        The attribute SHOULD be set based on the instrumentation's best
        knowledge and may differ from the actual model provider.

        Multiple providers, including Azure OpenAI, Gemini, and AI hosting platforms
        are accessible using the OpenAI REST API and corresponding client libraries,
        but may proxy or host models from different providers.

        The `gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.response.model`, and `server.address`
        attributes may help identify the actual system in use.

        The `gen_ai.provider.name` attribute acts as a discriminator that
        identifies the GenAI telemetry format flavor specific to that provider
        within GenAI semantic conventions.
        It SHOULD be set consistently with provider-specific attributes and signals.
        For example, GenAI spans, metrics, and events related to AWS Bedrock
        should have the `gen_ai.provider.name` set to `aws.bedrock` and include
        applicable `aws.bedrock.*` attributes and are not expected to include
        `openai.*` attributes.

        If the HTTP request method is not known to instrumentation, it MUST set the `http.request.method` attribute to `_OTHER`.

        If the HTTP instrumentation could end up converting valid HTTP request methods to `_OTHER`, then it MUST provide a way to override
        the list of known HTTP methods. If this override is done via environment variable, then the environment variable MUST be named

        (this list MUST be a full override of the default known method, it is not a list of known methods in addition to the defaults).

        HTTP method names are case-sensitive and `http.request.method` attribute value MUST match a known HTTP method name exactly.
        Instrumentations for specific web frameworks that consider HTTP methods to be case insensitive, SHOULD populate a canonical equivalent.

        If the HTTP request method is not known to instrumentation, it MUST set the `http.request.method` attribute to `_OTHER`.

        If the HTTP instrumentation could end up converting valid HTTP request methods to `_OTHER`, then it MUST provide a way to override
        the list of known HTTP methods. If this override is done via environment variable, then the environment variable MUST be named
        OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_HTTP_KNOWN_METHODS and support a comma-separated list of case-sensitive known HTTP methods
        (this list MUST be a full override of the default known method, it is not a list of known methods in addition to the defaults).

        HTTP method names are case-sensitive and `http.request.method` attribute value MUST match a known HTTP method name exactly.
        Instrumentations for specific web frameworks that consider HTTP methods to be case insensitive, SHOULD populate a canonical equivalent.
        Tracing instrumentations that do so, MUST also set `http.request.method_original` to the original value.

        The `error.type` value SHOULD be predictable and SHOULD have low cardinality.
        Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

        The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low, but
        telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
        should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time, when no
        additional filters are applied.

      brief: HTTP request method.
      note: |
        HTTP request method value SHOULD be "known" to the instrumentation.
        By default, this convention defines "known" methods as the ones listed in [RFC9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-methods),
        the PATCH method defined in [RFC5789](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789.html)
        and the QUERY method defined in [httpbis-safe-method-w-body](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpbis-safe-method-w-body/?include_text=1).

        If the HTTP request method is not known to instrumentation, it MUST set the `http.request.method` attribute to `_OTHER`.

        If the HTTP instrumentation could end up converting valid HTTP request methods to `_OTHER`, then it MUST provide a way to override
        the list of known HTTP methods. If this override is done via environment variable, then the environment variable MUST be named
        OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_HTTP_KNOWN_METHODS and support a comma-separated list of case-sensitive known HTTP methods
        (this list MUST be a full override of the default known method, it is not a list of known methods in addition to the defaults).

        HTTP method names are case-sensitive and `http.request.method` attribute value MUST match a known HTTP method name exactly.
        Instrumentations for specific web frameworks that consider HTTP methods to be case insensitive, SHOULD populate a canonical equivalent.
        Tracing instrumentations that do so, MUST also set `http.request.method_original` to the original value.

        A static path segment is a part of the route template with a fixed, low-cardinality value. This includes literal strings like `/users/` and placeholders that
        are constrained to a finite, predefined set of values, e.g. `{controller}` or `{action}`.

        A dynamic path segment is a placeholder for a value that can have high cardinality and is not constrained to a predefined list like static path segments.

        Instrumentations SHOULD use routing information provided by the corresponding web framework. They SHOULD pick the most precise source of routing information and MAY
        support custom route formatting. Instrumentations SHOULD document the format and the API used to obtain the route string.

        The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low, but
        telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
        should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time, when no

      brief: HTTP request method.
      note: |
        HTTP request method value SHOULD be "known" to the instrumentation.
        By default, this convention defines "known" methods as the ones listed in [RFC9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-methods),
        the PATCH method defined in [RFC5789](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789.html)
        and the QUERY method defined in [httpbis-safe-method-w-body](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpbis-safe-method-w-body/?include_text=1).

        If the HTTP request method is not known to instrumentation, it MUST set the `http.request.method` attribute to `_OTHER`.

        If the HTTP instrumentation could end up converting valid HTTP request methods to `_OTHER`, then it MUST provide a way to override
        the list of known HTTP methods. If this override is done via environment variable, then the environment variable MUST be named
        OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_HTTP_KNOWN_METHODS and support a comma-separated list of case-sensitive known HTTP methods
        (this list MUST be a full override of the default known method, it is not a list of known methods in addition to the defaults).

        HTTP method names are case-sensitive and `http.request.method` attribute value MUST match a known HTTP method name exactly.
        Instrumentations for specific web frameworks that consider HTTP methods to be case insensitive, SHOULD populate a canonical equivalent.
        Tracing instrumentations that do so, MUST also set `http.request.method_original` to the original value.

        The matched route template for the request. This MUST be low-cardinality and include all static path segments, with dynamic path segments represented with placeholders.
      note: |
        MUST NOT be populated when this is not supported by the HTTP server framework as the route attribute should have low-cardinality and the URI path can NOT substitute it.
        SHOULD include the [application root](/docs/http/http-spans.md#http-server-definitions) if there is one.

        A static path segment is a part of the route template with a fixed, low-cardinality value. This includes literal strings like `/users/` and placeholders that
        are constrained to a finite, predefined set of values, e.g. `{controller}` or `{action}`.

        A dynamic path segment is a placeholder for a value that can have high cardinality and is not constrained to a predefined list like static path segments.

        Instrumentations SHOULD use routing information provided by the corresponding web framework. They SHOULD pick the most precise source of routing information and MAY
        support custom route formatting. Instrumentations SHOULD document the format and the API used to obtain the route string.

      note: |
        If the request fails with an error before response status code was sent or received,
        `error.type` SHOULD be set to exception type (its fully-qualified class name, if applicable)
        or a component-specific low cardinality error identifier.

        If response status code was sent or received and status indicates an error according to [HTTP span status definition](/docs/http/http-spans.md),
        `error.type` SHOULD be set to the status code number (represented as a string), an exception type (if thrown) or a component-specific error identifier.

        The `error.type` value SHOULD be predictable and SHOULD have low cardinality.
        Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

        The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low, but
        telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
        should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time, when no
        additional filters are applied.

        If the request has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

    note: |
      `hw.status` is currently specified as an *UpDownCounter* but would ideally be represented using a [*StateSet* as defined in OpenMetrics](https://github.com/prometheus/OpenMetrics/blob/v1.0.0/specification/OpenMetrics.md#stateset). This semantic convention will be updated once *StateSet* is specified in OpenTelemetry. This planned change is not expected to have any consequence on the way users query their timeseries backend to retrieve the values of `hw.status` over time.

      either == 0, in which case you can conclude there were no restarts in the recent past, or > 0, in which case
      you can conclude there were restarts in the recent past, and not try and analyze the value beyond that.

      note: |
        Starting from .NET 9, Kestrel `kestrel.connection.duration` metric reports
        the following errors types when a corresponding error occurs:

        | Value | Description |
        | --- | --- |
        | `aborted_by_app` | The HTTP/1.1 connection was aborted when app code aborted an HTTP request with `HttpContext.Abort()`. |
        | `app_shutdown_timeout` | The connection was aborted during app shutdown. During shutdown, the server stops accepting new connections and HTTP requests, and it is given time for active requests to complete. If the app shutdown timeout is exceeded, all remaining connections are aborted. |
        | `closed_critical_stream` | A critical control stream for an HTTP/3 connection was closed. |
        | `connection_reset` | The connection was reset while there were active HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 streams on the connection. |
        | `error_after_starting_response` | An error such as an unhandled application exception or invalid request body occurred after the response was started, causing an abort of the HTTP/1.1 connection. |
        | `error_reading_headers` | An error occurred when decoding HPACK headers in an HTTP/2 `HEADERS` frame. |
        | `error_writing_headers` | An error occurred when encoding HPACK headers in an HTTP/2 `HEADERS` frame. |
        | `flow_control_queue_size_exceeded` | The connection exceeded the outgoing flow control maximum queue size and was closed with `INTERNAL_ERROR`. This can be caused by an excessive number of HTTP/2 stream resets. For more information, see [Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2023-44487](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/93303). |
        | `flow_control_window_exceeded` | The client sent more data than allowed by the current flow-control window. |
        | `frame_after_stream_close` | An HTTP/2 frame was received on a closed stream. |
        | `insufficient_tls_version` | The connection doesn't have TLS 1.2 or greater, as required by HTTP/2. |
        | `invalid_body_reader_state` | An error occurred when draining the request body, aborting the HTTP/1.1 connection. This could be caused by app code reading the request body and missing a call to `PipeReader.AdvanceTo` in a finally block. |
        | `invalid_data_padding` | An HTTP/2 `HEADER` or `DATA` frame has an invalid amount of padding. |
        | `invalid_frame_length` | An HTTP/2 frame was received with an invalid frame payload length. The frame could contain a payload that is not valid for the type, or a `DATA` frame payload does not match the length specified in the frame header. |
        | `invalid_handshake` | An invalid HTTP/2 handshake was received. |
        | `invalid_http_version` | The connection received an HTTP request with the wrong version. For example, a browser sends an HTTP/1.1 request to a plain-text HTTP/2 connection. |
        | `invalid_request_headers` | The HTTP request contains invalid headers. This error can occur in a number of scenarios: a header might not be allowed by the HTTP protocol, such as a pseudo-header in the `HEADERS` frame of an HTTP/2 request. A header could also have an invalid value, such as a non-integer `content-length`, or a header name or value might contain invalid characters. |
        | `invalid_request_line` | The first line of an HTTP/1.1 request was invalid, potentially due to invalid content or exceeding the allowed limit. Configured by `KestrelServerLimits.MaxRequestLineSize`. |
        | `invalid_settings` | The connection received an HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 `SETTINGS` frame with invalid settings. |
        | `invalid_stream_id` | An HTTP/2 stream with an invalid stream ID was received. |
        | `invalid_window_update_size` | The server received an HTTP/2 `WINDOW_UPDATE` frame with a zero increment, or an increment that caused a flow-control window to exceed the maximum size. |
        | `io_error` | An `IOException` occurred while reading or writing HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 connection data. |
        | `keep_alive_timeout` | There was no activity on the connection, and the keep-alive timeout configured by `KestrelServerLimits.KeepAliveTimeout` was exceeded. |
        | `max_concurrent_connections_exceeded` | The connection exceeded the maximum concurrent connection limit. Configured by `KestrelServerLimits.MaxConcurrentConnections`. |
        | `max_frame_length_exceeded` | The connection received an HTTP/2 frame that exceeded the size limit specified by `Http2Limits.MaxFrameSize`. |
        | `max_request_body_size_exceeded` | The HTTP request body exceeded the maximum request body size limit. Configured by `KestrelServerLimits.MaxRequestBodySize`. |
        | `max_request_header_count_exceeded` | The HTTP request headers exceeded the maximum count limit. Configured by `KestrelServerLimits.MaxRequestHeaderCount`. |
        | `max_request_headers_total_size_exceeded` | The HTTP request headers exceeded the maximum total size limit. Configured by `KestrelServerLimits.MaxRequestHeadersTotalSize`. |
        | `min_request_body_data_rate` | Reading the request body timed out due to data arriving too slowly. Configured by `KestrelServerLimits.MinRequestBodyDataRate`. |
        | `min_response_data_rate` | Writing the response timed out because the client did not read it at the specified minimum data rate. Configured by `KestrelServerLimits.MinResponseDataRate`. |
        | `missing_stream_end` | The connection received an HTTP/2 `HEADERS` frame for trailers without a stream end flag. |
        | `output_queue_size_exceeded` | The connection exceeded the output queue size and was closed with `INTERNAL_ERROR`. This can be caused by an excessive number of HTTP/2 stream resets. For more information, see [Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2023-44487](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/93303). |
        | `request_headers_timeout` | Request headers timed out while waiting for headers to be received after the request started. Configured by `KestrelServerLimits.RequestHeadersTimeout`. |
        | `response_content_length_mismatch` | The HTTP response body sent data that didn't match the response's `content-length` header. |
        | `server_timeout` | The connection timed out with the `IConnectionTimeoutFeature`. |
        | `stream_creation_error` | The HTTP/3 connection received a stream that it wouldn't accept. For example, the client created duplicate control streams. |
        | `stream_reset_limit_exceeded` | The connection received an excessive number of HTTP/2 stream resets and was closed with `ENHANCE_YOUR_CALM`. For more information, see [Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2023-44487](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/93303). |
        | `stream_self_dependency` | The connection received an HTTP/2 frame that caused a frame to depend on itself. |
        | `tls_handshake_failed` | An error occurred during the TLS handshake for a connection. Only reported for HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 connections. The TLS handshake for HTTP/3 is internal to QUIC transport. ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
        | `tls_not_supported` | A TLS handshake was received by an endpoint that isn't configured to support TLS. |
        | `unexpected_end_of_request_content` | The HTTP/1.1 request body ended before the data specified by the `content-length` header or chunked transfer encoding mechanism was received. |
        | `unexpected_frame` | An unexpected HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 frame type was received. The frame type is either unknown, unsupported, or invalid for the current stream state. |
        | `unknown_stream` | An HTTP/2 frame was received on an unknown stream. |
        | `write_canceled` | The cancellation of a response body write aborted the HTTP/1.1 connection. |

        In other cases, `error.type` contains the fully qualified type name of the exception.

      note: |
        The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

        When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
        canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

        Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

        The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
        Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
        should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
        additional filters are applied.

        If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

        If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
        it's RECOMMENDED to:

        - Use a domain-specific attribute
        - Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

      note: |
        The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

        When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
        canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

        Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

        The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
        Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
        should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
        additional filters are applied.

        If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

        If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
        it's RECOMMENDED to:

        - Use a domain-specific attribute
        - Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

        The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

        When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
        canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

        Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

        The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
        Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
        should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
        additional filters are applied.

        If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

        If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
        it's RECOMMENDED to:

        - Use a domain-specific attribute
        - Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

      brief: |
        A name uniquely identifying the instance of the OpenTelemetry component within its containing SDK instance.
      note: |
        Implementations SHOULD ensure a low cardinality for this attribute, even across application or SDK restarts.
        E.g. implementations MUST NOT use UUIDs as values for this attribute.

        Implementations MAY achieve these goals by following a `<otel.component.type>/<instance-counter>` pattern, e.g. `batching_span_processor/0`.
        Hereby `otel.component.type` refers to the corresponding attribute value of the component.

        The value of `instance-counter` MAY be automatically assigned by the component and uniqueness within the enclosing SDK instance MUST be guaranteed.
        For example, `<instance-counter>` MAY be implemented by using a monotonically increasing counter (starting with `0`), which is incremented every time an
        instance of the given component type is started.

        With this implementation, for example the first Batching Span Processor would have `batching_span_processor/0`
        as `otel.component.name`, the second one `batching_span_processor/1` and so on.
        These values will therefore be reused in the case of an application restart.

      For successful exports, `error.type` MUST NOT be set. For failed exports, `error.type` MUST contain the failure cause.
      For exporters with partial success semantics (e.g. OTLP with `rejected_log_records`), rejected log records MUST count as failed and only non-rejected log records count as success.
      If no rejection reason is available, `rejected` SHOULD be used as value for `error.type`.

      For exporters with partial success semantics (e.g. OTLP with `rejected_data_points`), rejected data points MUST count as failed and only non-rejected data points count as success.
      If no rejection reason is available, `rejected` SHOULD be used as value for `error.type`.

        Implementations SHOULD ensure a low cardinality for this attribute, even across application or SDK restarts.

        Implementations MAY achieve these goals by following a `<otel.component.type>/<instance-counter>` pattern, e.g. `batching_span_processor/0`.
        Hereby `otel.component.type` refers to the corresponding attribute value of the component.

        The value of `instance-counter` MAY be automatically assigned by the component and uniqueness within the enclosing SDK instance MUST be guaranteed.
        For example, `<instance-counter>` MAY be implemented by using a monotonically increasing counter (starting with `0`), which is incremented every time an
        instance of the given component type is started.

        With this implementation, for example the first Batching Span Processor would have `batching_span_processor/0`
        as `otel.component.name`, the second one `batching_span_processor/1` and so on.

      brief: |
        Describes a class of error the operation ended with.
      note: |
        The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

        When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
        canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

        Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

        The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
        Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
        should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
        additional filters are applied.

        If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

        If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
        it's RECOMMENDED to:

        - Use a domain-specific attribute
        - Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

        Implementations SHOULD ensure a low cardinality for this attribute, even across application or SDK restarts.
        E.g. implementations MUST NOT use UUIDs as values for this attribute.

        Implementations MAY achieve these goals by following a `<otel.component.type>/<instance-counter>` pattern, e.g. `batching_span_processor/0`.
        Hereby `otel.component.type` refers to the corresponding attribute value of the component.

        The value of `instance-counter` MAY be automatically assigned by the component and uniqueness within the enclosing SDK instance MUST be guaranteed.
        For example, `<instance-counter>` MAY be implemented by using a monotonically increasing counter (starting with `0`), which is incremented every time an
        instance of the given component type is started.

        With this implementation, for example the first Batching Span Processor would have `batching_span_processor/0`
        as `otel.component.name`, the second one `batching_span_processor/1` and so on.
        These values will therefore be reused in the case of an application restart.

        Describes a class of error the operation ended with.
      note: |
        The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

        When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
        canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

        Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

        The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
        Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
        should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
        additional filters are applied.

        If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

        If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
        it's RECOMMENDED to:

        - Use a domain-specific attribute
        - Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

      brief: |
        A name uniquely identifying the instance of the OpenTelemetry component within its containing SDK instance.
      note: |
        Implementations SHOULD ensure a low cardinality for this attribute, even across application or SDK restarts.
        E.g. implementations MUST NOT use UUIDs as values for this attribute.

        Implementations MAY achieve these goals by following a `<otel.component.type>/<instance-counter>` pattern, e.g. `batching_span_processor/0`.
        Hereby `otel.component.type` refers to the corresponding attribute value of the component.

        The value of `instance-counter` MAY be automatically assigned by the component and uniqueness within the enclosing SDK instance MUST be guaranteed.
        For example, `<instance-counter>` MAY be implemented by using a monotonically increasing counter (starting with `0`), which is incremented every time an
        instance of the given component type is started.

        With this implementation, for example the first Batching Span Processor would have `batching_span_processor/0`
        as `otel.component.name`, the second one `batching_span_processor/1` and so on.
        These values will therefore be reused in the case of an application restart.

          brief: |
            A fallback error value to be used when the instrumentation doesn't define a custom value.
          stability: stable
      examples:
      - queue_full
      brief: |
        A low-cardinality description of the failure reason. SDK Batching Log Record Processors MUST use `queue_full` for log records dropped due to a full queue.
      note: |
        The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

        When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
        canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

        Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

        The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
        Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
        should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
        additional filters are applied.

        If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

        If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
        it's RECOMMENDED to:

        - Use a domain-specific attribute
        - Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

    brief: The number of log records for which the processing has finished, either successful or failed.
    note: |
      For successful processing, `error.type` MUST NOT be set. For failed processing, `error.type` MUST contain the failure cause.
      For the SDK Simple and Batching Log Record Processor a log record is considered to be processed already when it has been submitted to the exporter,
      not when the corresponding export call has finished.

        Implementations SHOULD ensure a low cardinality for this attribute, even across application or SDK restarts.
        E.g. implementations MUST NOT use UUIDs as values for this attribute.

        Implementations MAY achieve these goals by following a `<otel.component.type>/<instance-counter>` pattern, e.g. `batching_span_processor/0`.
        Hereby `otel.component.type` refers to the corresponding attribute value of the component.

        The value of `instance-counter` MAY be automatically assigned by the component and uniqueness within the enclosing SDK instance MUST be guaranteed.
        For example, `<instance-counter>` MAY be implemented by using a monotonically increasing counter (starting with `0`), which is incremented every time an
        instance of the given component type is started.

        With this implementation, for example the first Batching Span Processor would have `batching_span_processor/0`
        as `otel.component.name`, the second one `batching_span_processor/1` and so on.
        These values will therefore be reused in the case of an application restart.

          brief: |
            A fallback error value to be used when the instrumentation doesn't define a custom value.

      examples:
      - queue_full
      brief: |
        A low-cardinality description of the failure reason. SDK Batching Span Processors MUST use `queue_full` for spans dropped due to a full queue.
      note: |
        The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

        When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
        canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

        Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

        The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
        Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
        should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
        additional filters are applied.

        If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

        If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
        it's RECOMMENDED to:

        - Use a domain-specific attribute
        - Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

    note: |
      For successful processing, `error.type` MUST NOT be set. For failed processing, `error.type` MUST contain the failure cause.
      For the SDK Simple and Batching Span Processor a span is considered to be processed already when it has been submitted to the exporter, not when the corresponding export call has finished.

      brief: |
        Describes a class of error the operation ended with.
      note: |
        If the RPC fails with an error before status code is returned,
        `error.type` SHOULD be set to the exception type (its fully-qualified class name, if applicable)
        or a component-specific, low cardinality error identifier.

        If a response status code is returned and status indicates an error,
        `error.type` SHOULD be set to that status code. Check system-specific conventions
        for the details on which values of `rpc.response.status_code` are considered errors.

        The `error.type` value SHOULD be predictable and SHOULD have low cardinality.
        Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

        If the request has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set
        `error.type`.

      note: |
        Usually it represents an error code, but may also represent partial success, warning, or differentiate between various types of successful outcomes.
        Semantic conventions for individual RPC frameworks SHOULD document what `rpc.response.status_code` means in the context of that system and which values are considered to represent errors.

    note: |
      This is an alternative to `system.memory.usage` metric with `state=free`.
      Linux starting from 3.14 exports "available" memory. It takes "free" memory as a baseline, and then factors in kernel-specific values.
      This is supposed to be more accurate than just "free" memory.
      For reference, see the calculations [here](https://superuser.com/a/980821).

      equivalent to concatenating `rpc.service` and `rpc.method` with `.` and
      consistent with the naming guidelines for RPC client spans.

      AWS SDK span attributes are based on the request or response parameters
      in AWS SDK API calls. The conventions have been collected over time based
      on feedback from AWS users of tracing and will continue to increase as new
      interesting conventions are found.

        for a given operation, for example:

        - when client framework being instrumented manages conversation history
        (see [LlamaIndex chat store](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/storing/chat_stores/))
        - when instrumenting GenAI client libraries that maintain conversation on the backend side
        (see [AWS Bedrock agent sessions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents-session-state.html),
        [OpenAI Assistant threads](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/threads))

        Application developers that manage conversation history MAY add conversation id to GenAI and other
        spans or logs using custom span or log record processors or hooks provided by instrumentation
        libraries.

        Parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be sanitized. Even though parameterized query text can potentially have sensitive data, by using a parameterized query the user is giving a strong signal that any sensitive data will be passed as parameter values, and the benefit to observability of capturing the static part of the query text by default outweighs the risk.

        Batch operations:

        - `execute_batch`

        Bulk operations:

        - `execute_bulk` SHOULD be used on spans reported for methods like
          [`executeBulkOperations`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.azure/azure-cosmos/latest/com/azure/cosmos/CosmosAsyncContainer.html#executeBulkOperations(reactor.core.publisher.Flux)),
          which represents a bulk execution of multiple operations.
        - `bulk_{operation name}` (`bulk_create_item`, `bulk_upsert_item`, etc) SHOULD be used on spans describing individual operations (when they are reported)
          within the bulk. This pattern SHOULD be used when instrumentation creates span per each operation, but operations are buffered and then performed in bulk.
          For example, this applies when [`AllowBulkExecution`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cosmos.cosmosclientoptions.allowbulkexecution)
          property is configured on the `Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos` client.

        When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its

        Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

        The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
        Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
        should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
        additional filters are applied.

        If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

        Parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be sanitized. Even though parameterized query text can potentially have sensitive data, by using a parameterized query the user is giving a strong signal that any sensitive data will be passed as parameter values, and the benefit to observability of capturing the static part of the query text by default outweighs the risk.

        For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same query text then that query text SHOULD be used, otherwise all of the individual query texts SHOULD be concatenated with separator `; ` or some other database system specific separator if more applicable.
        Parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be sanitized. Even though parameterized query text can potentially have sensitive data, by using a parameterized query the user is giving a strong signal that any sensitive data will be passed as parameter values, and the benefit to observability of capturing the static part of the query text by default outweighs the risk.

    note: |
      Instrumentations SHOULD, when possible, record database spans that cover the duration of
      the corresponding API call as if it was observed by the caller (such as client application).
      For example, if a transient issue happened and was retried within this database call, the corresponding
      span should cover the duration of the logical operation with all retries.

      When a database client provides higher-level convenience APIs for specific operations
      (e.g., calling a stored procedure), which internally generate and execute a generic query,
      it is RECOMMENDED to instrument the higher-level convenience APIs.
      These often allow setting `db.operation.*` attributes, which usually are not
      readily available at the generic query level.

      **Span name** is covered in the [Name](/docs/db/database-spans.md#name) section.

      **Span kind** SHOULD be `CLIENT`. It MAY be set to `INTERNAL` on spans representing
      in-memory database calls.
      It's RECOMMENDED to use `CLIENT` kind when database system being instrumented usually
      runs in a different process than its client or when database calls happen over
      instrumented protocol such as HTTP.

      **Span status** SHOULD follow the [Recording Errors](/docs/general/recording-errors.md) document.
      Semantic conventions for individual systems SHOULD specify which values of `db.response.status_code`
      classify as errors.

      brief: HTTP request method.
      note: |
        HTTP request method value SHOULD be "known" to the instrumentation.
        By default, this convention defines "known" methods as the ones listed in [RFC9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-methods),
        the PATCH method defined in [RFC5789](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789.html)
        and the QUERY method defined in [httpbis-safe-method-w-body](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpbis-safe-method-w-body/?include_text=1).

        If the HTTP request method is not known to instrumentation, it MUST set the `http.request.method` attribute to `_OTHER`.

        If the HTTP instrumentation could end up converting valid HTTP request methods to `_OTHER`, then it MUST provide a way to override
        the list of known HTTP methods. If this override is done via environment variable, then the environment variable MUST be named
        OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_HTTP_KNOWN_METHODS and support a comma-separated list of case-sensitive known HTTP methods
        (this list MUST be a full override of the default known method, it is not a list of known methods in addition to the defaults).

        HTTP method names are case-sensitive and `http.request.method` attribute value MUST match a known HTTP method name exactly.
        Instrumentations for specific web frameworks that consider HTTP methods to be case insensitive, SHOULD populate a canonical equivalent.
        Tracing instrumentations that do so, MUST also set `http.request.method_original` to the original value.

        For network calls, URL usually has `scheme://host[:port][path][?query][#fragment]` format, where the fragment
        is not transmitted over HTTP, but if it is known, it SHOULD be included nevertheless.

        `url.full` MUST NOT contain credentials passed via URL in form of `https://username:password@www.example.com/`.
        In such case username and password SHOULD be redacted and attribute's value SHOULD be `https://REDACTED:REDACTED@www.example.com/`.

        `url.full` SHOULD capture the absolute URL when it is available (or can be reconstructed).

        Sensitive content provided in `url.full` SHOULD be scrubbed when instrumentations can identify it.

        ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)
        Query string values for the following keys SHOULD be redacted by default and replaced by the
        value `REDACTED`:

        * [`AWSAccessKeyId`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/RESTAuthentication.html#RESTAuthenticationQueryStringAuth)
        * [`Signature`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/RESTAuthentication.html#RESTAuthenticationQueryStringAuth)

        * [`X-Goog-Signature`](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/signed-urls)

        This list is subject to change over time.

        When a query string value is redacted, the query string key SHOULD still be preserved, e.g.

        Parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be sanitized. Even though parameterized query text can potentially have sensitive data, by using a parameterized query the user is giving a strong signal that any sensitive data will be passed as parameter values, and the benefit to observability of capturing the static part of the query text by default outweighs the risk.

      brief: |
        Database response code recorded as a string.
      note: |
        SQL defines [SQLSTATE](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLSTATE) as a database
        return code which is adopted by some database systems like PostgreSQL.
        See [PostgreSQL error codes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/errcodes-appendix.html)
        for the details.

        Other systems like MySQL, Oracle, or MS SQL Server define vendor-specific
        error codes. Database SQL drivers usually provide access to both properties.
        For example, in Java, the [`SQLException`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/sql/SQLException.html)
        class reports them with `getSQLState()` and `getErrorCode()` methods.

        Instrumentations SHOULD populate the `db.response.status_code` with the
        the most specific code available to them.

        Here's a non-exhaustive list of databases that report vendor-specific
        codes with granularity higher than SQLSTATE (or don't report SQLSTATE
        at all):

        - [DB2 SQL codes](https://www.ibm.com/docs/db2-for-zos/12?topic=codes-sql).
        - [Maria DB error codes](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-error-code-reference/)
        - [Microsoft SQL Server errors](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/errors-events/database-engine-events-and-errors)
        - [MySQL error codes](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/9.0/en/error-reference-introduction.html)
        - [Oracle error codes](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28278/toc.htm)
        - [SQLite result codes](https://www.sqlite.org/rescode.html)

        These systems SHOULD set the `db.response.status_code` to a
        known vendor-specific error code. If only SQLSTATE is available,
        it SHOULD be used.

        When multiple error codes are available and specificity is unclear,
        instrumentation SHOULD set the `db.response.status_code` to the
        concatenated string of all codes with '/' used as a separator.

        For example, generic DB instrumentation that detected an error and has
        SQLSTATE `"42000"` and vendor-specific `1071` should set
        `db.response.status_code` to `"42000/1071"`."

      The span describes DNS lookup or reverse lookup performed with one of the methods on [System.Net.Dns](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.net.dns) class.
    note: |
      DNS spans track logical operations rather than physical DNS calls and the actual behavior depends on the
      resolver implementation which could be changed in the future versions of .NET.
      .NET 9 uses OS DNS resolver which may do zero or more physical lookups for one API call.

      When the *DNS lookup* span is reported along with *HTTP connection setup* and *socket connect* span,
      the *DNS lookup* span span becomes a child of *HTTP connection setup* and a sibling of *socket connect*.

      DNS lookup duration is also reported by [`dns.lookup.duration` metric](/docs/dotnet/dotnet-dns-metrics.md#metric-dnslookupduration).

      Corresponding `Activity.OperationName` is `Experimental.System.Net.NameResolution.DnsLookup`, `ActivitySource` name - `Experimental.System.Net.NameResolution`.
      Added in .NET 9.

      **Span name** SHOULD be `DNS lookup {dns.question.name}` for DNS lookup (IP addresses from host name)
      and `DNS reverse lookup {dns.question.name}` for reverse lookup (host names from IP address).

      The span describes the establishment of the HTTP connection. It includes the time it takes to resolve the DNS, establish the socket connection, and perform the TLS handshake.
    note: |
      There is no parent-child relationship between the [*HTTP client request*](/docs/dotnet/dotnet-network-traces.md#http-client-request) and the
      [*HTTP connection setup*]/docs/dotnet/dotnet-network-traces.md(/docs/dotnet/dotnet-network-traces.md#http-connection-setup) spans;
      the latter will always be a root span, defining a separate trace.

      However, if the connection attempt represented by the [*HTTP connection setup*](/docs/dotnet/dotnet-network-traces.md#http-connection-setup) span results in a
      successful HTTP connection, and that connection is picked up by a request to serve it, the instrumentation adds a link
      to the [*HTTP client request*](/docs/dotnet/dotnet-network-traces.md#http-client-request) span pointing to the *HTTP connection setup* span.
      I.e., each request is linked to the connection that served this request.

      Corresponding `Activity.OperationName` is `Experimental.System.Net.Http.Connections.ConnectionSetup`, `ActivitySource` name - `Experimental.System.Net.Http.Connections`.

      The span is reported only if there was no connection readily available when request has started.
      It's reported as a child of *HTTP client request* span.

      The span ends when the connection is obtained - it could happen when an existing connection becomes available or once
      a new connection is established, so the duration of *Wait For Connection* span is different from duration of the
      [*HTTP connection setup*](/docs/dotnet/dotnet-network-traces.md#http-connection-setup) span.

      brief: The Generative AI provider as identified by the client or server instrumentation.
      note: |
        The attribute SHOULD be set based on the instrumentation's best
        knowledge and may differ from the actual model provider.

        Multiple providers, including Azure OpenAI, Gemini, and AI hosting platforms
        are accessible using the OpenAI REST API and corresponding client libraries,
        but may proxy or host models from different providers.

        The `gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.response.model`, and `server.address`
        attributes may help identify the actual system in use.

        The `gen_ai.provider.name` attribute acts as a discriminator that
        identifies the GenAI telemetry format flavor specific to that provider
        within GenAI semantic conventions.
        It SHOULD be set consistently with provider-specific attributes and signals.
        For example, GenAI spans, metrics, and events related to AWS Bedrock
        should have the `gen_ai.provider.name` set to `aws.bedrock` and include
        applicable `aws.bedrock.*` attributes and are not expected to include
        `openai.*` attributes.

      brief: The Generative AI provider as identified by the client or server instrumentation.
      note: |
        The attribute SHOULD be set based on the instrumentation's best
        knowledge and may differ from the actual model provider.

        Multiple providers, including Azure OpenAI, Gemini, and AI hosting platforms
        are accessible using the OpenAI REST API and corresponding client libraries,
        but may proxy or host models from different providers.

        The `gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.response.model`, and `server.address`
        attributes may help identify the actual system in use.

        The `gen_ai.provider.name` attribute acts as a discriminator that
        identifies the GenAI telemetry format flavor specific to that provider
        within GenAI semantic conventions.
        It SHOULD be set consistently with provider-specific attributes and signals.
        For example, GenAI spans, metrics, and events related to AWS Bedrock
        should have the `gen_ai.provider.name` set to `aws.bedrock` and include
        applicable `aws.bedrock.*` attributes and are not expected to include
        `openai.*` attributes.

      This span represents a client call to Generative AI model or service that generates a response or requests a tool call based on the input prompt.
    note: |
      **Span name** SHOULD be `{gen_ai.operation.name} {gen_ai.request.model}`.
      Semantic conventions for individual GenAI systems and frameworks MAY specify different span name format
      and MUST follow the overall [guidelines for span names](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/v1.37.0/specification/trace/api.md#span).

      **Span kind** SHOULD be `CLIENT` and MAY be set to `INTERNAL` on spans representing
      call to models running in the same process. It's RECOMMENDED to use `CLIENT` kind
      when the GenAI system being instrumented usually runs in a different process than its
      client or when the GenAI call happens over instrumented protocol such as HTTP.

      brief: The Generative AI provider as identified by the client or server instrumentation.
      note: |
        The attribute SHOULD be set based on the instrumentation's best
        knowledge and may differ from the actual model provider.

        Multiple providers, including Azure OpenAI, Gemini, and AI hosting platforms
        are accessible using the OpenAI REST API and corresponding client libraries,
        but may proxy or host models from different providers.

        The `gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.response.model`, and `server.address`
        attributes may help identify the actual system in use.

        The `gen_ai.provider.name` attribute acts as a discriminator that
        identifies the GenAI telemetry format flavor specific to that provider
        within GenAI semantic conventions.
        It SHOULD be set consistently with provider-specific attributes and signals.
        For example, GenAI spans, metrics, and events related to AWS Bedrock
        should have the `gen_ai.provider.name` set to `aws.bedrock` and include
        applicable `aws.bedrock.*` attributes and are not expected to include
        `openai.*` attributes.

        Data sources are used by AI agents and RAG applications to store grounding data. A data source may be an external database, object store, document collection, website, or any other storage system used by the GenAI agent or application. The `gen_ai.data_source.id` SHOULD match the identifier used by the GenAI system rather than a name specific to the external storage, such as a database or object store. Semantic conventions referencing `gen_ai.data_source.id` MAY also leverage additional attributes, such as `db.*`, to further identify and describe the data source.

    note: |
      The `gen_ai.operation.name` SHOULD be `invoke_agent`.

      **Span name** SHOULD be `invoke_agent {gen_ai.agent.name}` if `gen_ai.agent.name` is readily available.
      When `gen_ai.agent.name` is not available, it SHOULD be `invoke_agent`.
      Semantic conventions for individual GenAI systems and frameworks MAY specify different span name format.

      **Span kind** SHOULD be `CLIENT` and MAY be set to `INTERNAL` on spans representing
      invocation of agents running in the same process.
      It's RECOMMENDED to use `CLIENT` kind when the agent being instrumented usually runs
      in a different process than its caller or when the agent invocation happens over
      instrumented protocol such as HTTP.

      Examples of span kinds for different agent scenarios:

      - `CLIENT`: Remote agent services (e.g., OpenAI Assistants API, AWS Bedrock Agents)
      - `INTERNAL`: In-process agents (e.g., LangChain agents, CrewAI agents)

      brief: HTTP request method.
      note: |
        HTTP request method value SHOULD be "known" to the instrumentation.
        By default, this convention defines "known" methods as the ones listed in [RFC9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-methods),
        the PATCH method defined in [RFC5789](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789.html)
        and the QUERY method defined in [httpbis-safe-method-w-body](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpbis-safe-method-w-body/?include_text=1).

        If the HTTP request method is not known to instrumentation, it MUST set the `http.request.method` attribute to `_OTHER`.

        If the HTTP instrumentation could end up converting valid HTTP request methods to `_OTHER`, then it MUST provide a way to override
        the list of known HTTP methods. If this override is done via environment variable, then the environment variable MUST be named
        OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_HTTP_KNOWN_METHODS and support a comma-separated list of case-sensitive known HTTP methods
        (this list MUST be a full override of the default known method, it is not a list of known methods in addition to the defaults).

        HTTP method names are case-sensitive and `http.request.method` attribute value MUST match a known HTTP method name exactly.
        Instrumentations for specific web frameworks that consider HTTP methods to be case insensitive, SHOULD populate a canonical equivalent.
        Tracing instrumentations that do so, MUST also set `http.request.method_original` to the original value.

        If response status code was sent or received and status indicates an error according to [HTTP span status definition](/docs/http/http-spans.md),

        Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

        The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low, but
        telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
        should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time, when no

      This span represents an outbound HTTP request.
    note: |
      There are two ways HTTP client spans can be implemented in an instrumentation:

      1. Instrumentations SHOULD create an HTTP span for each attempt to send an HTTP request over the wire.
         In case the request is resent, the resend attempts MUST follow the [HTTP resend spec](#http-request-retries-and-redirects).
         In this case, instrumentations SHOULD NOT (also) emit a logical encompassing HTTP client span.

      2. If for some reason it is not possible to emit a span for each send attempt (because e.g. the instrumented library does not expose hooks that would allow this),
         instrumentations MAY create an HTTP span for the top-most operation of the HTTP client.
         In this case, the `url.full` MUST be the absolute URL that was originally requested, before any HTTP-redirects that may happen when executing the request.

      **Span name:** refer to the [Span Name](/docs/http/http-spans.md#name) section.

      **Span kind** MUST be `CLIENT`.

      **Span status:** refer to the [Span Status](/docs/http/http-spans.md#status) section.

        SHOULD include the [application root](/docs/http/http-spans.md#http-server-definitions) if there is one.

        A static path segment is a part of the route template with a fixed, low-cardinality value. This includes literal strings like `/users/` and placeholders that
        are constrained to a finite, predefined set of values, e.g. `{controller}` or `{action}`.

        A dynamic path segment is a placeholder for a value that can have high cardinality and is not constrained to a predefined list like static path segments.

        Instrumentations SHOULD use routing information provided by the corresponding web framework. They SHOULD pick the most precise source of routing information and MAY
        support custom route formatting. Instrumentations SHOULD document the format and the API used to obtain the route string.

      brief: HTTP request method.
      note: |
        HTTP request method value SHOULD be "known" to the instrumentation.
        By default, this convention defines "known" methods as the ones listed in [RFC9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-methods),
        the PATCH method defined in [RFC5789](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789.html)
        and the QUERY method defined in [httpbis-safe-method-w-body](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpbis-safe-method-w-body/?include_text=1).

        If the HTTP request method is not known to instrumentation, it MUST set the `http.request.method` attribute to `_OTHER`.

        If the HTTP instrumentation could end up converting valid HTTP request methods to `_OTHER`, then it MUST provide a way to override
        the list of known HTTP methods. If this override is done via environment variable, then the environment variable MUST be named
        OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_HTTP_KNOWN_METHODS and support a comma-separated list of case-sensitive known HTTP methods
        (this list MUST be a full override of the default known method, it is not a list of known methods in addition to the defaults).

        HTTP method names are case-sensitive and `http.request.method` attribute value MUST match a known HTTP method name exactly.
        Instrumentations for specific web frameworks that consider HTTP methods to be case insensitive, SHOULD populate a canonical equivalent.
        Tracing instrumentations that do so, MUST also set `http.request.method_original` to the original value.

        or a component-specific low cardinality error identifier.

        If response status code was sent or received and status indicates an error according to [HTTP span status definition](/docs/http/http-spans.md),
        `error.type` SHOULD be set to the status code number (represented as a string), an exception type (if thrown) or a component-specific error identifier.

        The `error.type` value SHOULD be predictable and SHOULD have low cardinality.
        Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

        The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low, but
        telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
        should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time, when no
        additional filters are applied.

        or a single-item array containing a possibly comma-concatenated string, depending on the way
        the HTTP library provides access to headers.

        Including all request headers can be a security risk - explicit configuration helps avoid leaking sensitive information.

        The `User-Agent` header is already captured in the `user_agent.original` attribute.
        Users MAY explicitly configure instrumentations to capture them even though it is not recommended.

        The attribute value MUST consist of either multiple header values as an array of strings
        or a single-item array containing a possibly comma-concatenated string, depending on the way
        the HTTP library provides access to headers.

        Examples:

        - A header `Content-Type: application/json` SHOULD be recorded as the `http.request.header.content-type`
          attribute with value `["application/json"]`.
        - A header `X-Forwarded-For: 1.2.3.4, 1.2.3.5` SHOULD be recorded as the `http.request.header.x-forwarded-for`
          attribute with value `["1.2.3.4", "1.2.3.5"]` or `["1.2.3.4, 1.2.3.5"]` depending on the HTTP library.

        A semantic identifier for an evaluated flag value.
      note: |-
        A semantic identifier, commonly referred to as a variant, provides a means
        for referring to a value without including the value itself. This can
        provide additional context for understanding the meaning behind a value.
        For example, the variant `red` maybe be used for the value `#c05543`.

      brief: The evaluated value of the feature flag.
      note: |
        With some feature flag providers, feature flag results can be quite large or contain private or sensitive details.
        Because of this, `feature_flag.result.variant` is often the preferred attribute if it is available.

        It may be desirable to redact or otherwise limit the size and scope of `feature_flag.result.value` if possible.
        Because the evaluated flag value is unstructured and may be any type, it is left to the instrumentation author to determine how best to achieve this.
      stability: release_candidate
      requirement_level:

    brief: |
      Defines feature flag evaluation as an event.
    note: |
      A `feature_flag.evaluation` event SHOULD be emitted whenever a feature flag value is evaluated, which may happen many times over the course of an application lifecycle. For example, a website A/B testing different animations may evaluate a flag each time a button is clicked. A `feature_flag.evaluation` event is emitted on each evaluation even if the result is the same.

      brief: |
        A unique identifier representing the installation of an application on a specific device
      note: |
        Its value SHOULD persist across launches of the same application installation, including through application upgrades.
        It SHOULD change if the application is uninstalled or if all applications of the vendor are uninstalled.
        Additionally, users might be able to reset this value (e.g. by clearing application data).
        If an app is installed multiple times on the same device (e.g. in different accounts on Android), each `app.installation.id` SHOULD have a different value.
        If multiple OpenTelemetry SDKs are used within the same application, they SHOULD use the same value for `app.installation.id`.
        Hardware IDs (e.g. serial number, IMEI, MAC address) MUST NOT be used as the `app.installation.id`.

        For iOS, this value SHOULD be equal to the [vendor identifier](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidevice/identifierforvendor).

        For Android, examples of `app.installation.id` implementations include:

        - [Firebase Installation ID](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/manage-installations).
        - A globally unique UUID which is persisted across sessions in your application.
        - [App set ID](https://developer.android.com/identity/app-set-id).
        - [`Settings.getString(Settings.Secure.ANDROID_ID)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Settings.Secure#ANDROID_ID).

      A CICD worker is a component of the CICD system that performs work (eg. running pipeline tasks or performing sync).
      A single pipeline run may be distributed across multiple workers. Any OpenTelemetry signal associated with a worker should be associated to the worker that performed the corresponding work.
      For example, when a pipeline run involves several workers, its task run spans may reference the different `cicd.worker` resources corresponding to the workers that executed each task run. The pipeline run's parent span may instead reference the CICD controller as the `cicd.worker` resource.

      brief: |
        Cloud provider-specific native identifier of the monitored cloud resource (e.g. an [ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) on AWS, a [fully qualified resource ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/resources/resources/get-by-id) on Azure, a [full resource name](https://google.aip.dev/122#full-resource-names) on GCP)
      note: |
        On some cloud providers, it may not be possible to determine the full ID at startup,
        so it may be necessary to set `cloud.resource_id` as a span attribute instead.

        The exact value to use for `cloud.resource_id` depends on the cloud provider.
        The following well-known definitions MUST be used if you set this attribute and they apply:

        - **AWS Lambda:** The function [ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html).
          Take care not to use the "invoked ARN" directly but replace any
          [alias suffix](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-aliases.html)
          with the resolved function version, as the same runtime instance may be invocable with
          multiple different aliases.
        - **GCP:** The [URI of the resource](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/full-resource-names)
        - **Azure:** The [Fully Qualified Resource ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/resources/resources/get-by-id) of the invoked function,
          *not* the function app, having the form
          `/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_GUID>/resourceGroups/<RG>/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/<FUNCAPP>/functions/<FUNC>`.
          This means that a span attribute MUST be used, as an Azure function app can host multiple functions that would usually share
          a TracerProvider.

        Cloud provider-specific native identifier of the monitored cloud resource (e.g. an [ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) on AWS, a [fully qualified resource ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/resources/resources/get-by-id) on Azure, a [full resource name](https://google.aip.dev/122#full-resource-names) on GCP)
      note: |
        On some cloud providers, it may not be possible to determine the full ID at startup,
        so it may be necessary to set `cloud.resource_id` as a span attribute instead.

        The exact value to use for `cloud.resource_id` depends on the cloud provider.
        The following well-known definitions MUST be used if you set this attribute and they apply:

        - **AWS Lambda:** The function [ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html).
          Take care not to use the "invoked ARN" directly but replace any
          [alias suffix](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-aliases.html)
          with the resolved function version, as the same runtime instance may be invocable with
          multiple different aliases.
        - **GCP:** The [URI of the resource](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/full-resource-names)
        - **Azure:** The [Fully Qualified Resource ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/resources/resources/get-by-id) of the invoked function,
          *not* the function app, having the form
          `/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_GUID>/resourceGroups/<RG>/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/<FUNCAPP>/functions/<FUNC>`.
          This means that a span attribute MUST be used, as an Azure function app can host multiple functions that would usually share
          a TracerProvider.

        - **Google Cloud Run (Services):** The [revision](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/managing/revisions)
          (i.e., the function name plus the revision suffix).
        - **Google Cloud Functions:** The value of the

        It's recommended to set this attribute since e.g. too little memory can easily stop a Java AWS Lambda function from working correctly. On AWS Lambda, the environment variable `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_MEMORY_SIZE` provides this information (which must be multiplied by 1,048,576).

      brief: |
        The name of the single function that this runtime instance executes.
      note: |
        This is the name of the function as configured/deployed on the FaaS
        platform and is usually different from the name of the callback
        function (which may be stored in the
        [`code.namespace`/`code.function.name`](/docs/general/attributes.md#source-code-attributes)
        span attributes).

        For some cloud providers, the above definition is ambiguous. The following
        definition of function name MUST be used for this attribute
        (and consequently the span name) for the listed cloud providers/products:

        - **Azure:**  The full name `<FUNCAPP>/<FUNC>`, i.e., function app name
          followed by a forward slash followed by the function name (this form
          can also be seen in the resource JSON for the function).
          This means that a span attribute MUST be used, as an Azure function
          app can host multiple functions that would usually share
          a TracerProvider (see also the `cloud.resource_id` attribute).

        Collecting `host.id` from non-containerized systems

        **Non-privileged Machine ID Lookup**

        When collecting `host.id` for non-containerized systems non-privileged lookups
        of the machine id are preferred. SDK detector implementations MUST use the
        sources listed below to obtain the machine id.

        | OS | Primary | Fallback |
        | --- | --- | --- |
        | Linux | contents of `/etc/machine-id` | contents of `/var/lib/dbus/machine-id` |
        | BSD | contents of `/etc/hostid` | output of `kenv -q smbios.system.uuid` |
        | MacOS | `IOPlatformUUID` line from the output of `ioreg -rd1 -c "IOPlatformExpertDevice"` | - |
        | Windows | `MachineGuid` from registry `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography` | - |

        **Privileged Machine ID Lookup**

        The `host.id` can be looked up using privileged sources. For example, Linux
        systems can use the output of `dmidecode -t system`, `dmidecode -t baseboard`,
        `dmidecode -t chassis`, or read the corresponding data from the filesystem
        (e.g. `cat /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/product_id`,
        `cat /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/product_uuid`, etc), however, SDK resource
        detector implementations MUST not collect `host.id` from privileged sources. If
        privileged lookup of `host.id` is required, the value should be injected via the
        `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` environment variable.

      brief: |
        A pseudo-ID for the cluster, set to the UID of the `kube-system` namespace.
      note: |
        K8s doesn't have support for obtaining a cluster ID. If this is ever
        added, we will recommend collecting the `k8s.cluster.uid` through the
        official APIs. In the meantime, we are able to use the `uid` of the
        `kube-system` namespace as a proxy for cluster ID. Read on for the
        rationale.

        Every object created in a K8s cluster is assigned a distinct UID. The
        `kube-system` namespace is used by Kubernetes itself and will exist
        for the lifetime of the cluster. Using the `uid` of the `kube-system`
        namespace is a reasonable proxy for the K8s ClusterID as it will only
        change if the cluster is rebuilt. Furthermore, Kubernetes UIDs are
        UUIDs as standardized by
        [ISO/IEC 9834-8 and ITU-T X.667](https://www.itu.int/ITU-T/studygroups/com17/oid.html).

      brief: |
        The string ID of the service instance.
      note: |
        MUST be unique for each instance of the same `service.namespace,service.name` pair (in other words
        `service.namespace,service.name,service.instance.id` triplet MUST be globally unique). The ID helps to
        distinguish instances of the same service that exist at the same time (e.g. instances of a horizontally scaled
        service).

        Implementations, such as SDKs, are recommended to generate a random Version 1 or Version 4 [RFC
        4122](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt) UUID, but are free to use an inherent unique ID as the source of
        this value if stability is desirable. In that case, the ID SHOULD be used as source of a UUID Version 5 and
        SHOULD use the following UUID as the namespace: `4d63009a-8d0f-11ee-aad7-4c796ed8e320`.

        UUIDs are typically recommended, as only an opaque value for the purposes of identifying a service instance is
        needed. Similar to what can be seen in the man page for the
        [`/etc/machine-id`](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/machine-id.html) file, the underlying
        data, such as pod name and namespace should be treated as confidential, being the user's choice to expose it
        or not via another resource attribute.

        For applications running behind an application server (like unicorn), we do not recommend using one identifier
        for all processes participating in the application. Instead, it's recommended each division (e.g. a worker
        thread in unicorn) to have its own instance.id.

        It's not recommended for a Collector to set `service.instance.id` if it can't unambiguously determine the
        service instance that is generating that telemetry. For instance, creating an UUID based on `pod.name` will
        likely be wrong, as the Collector might not know from which container within that pod the telemetry originated.
        However, Collectors can set the `service.instance.id` if they can unambiguously determine the service instance
        for that telemetry. This is typically the case for scraping receivers, as they know the target address and
        port.

If `service.namespace` is not specified in the Resource then `service.name` is expected to be unique for all services that have no explicit namespace defined (so the empty/unspecified namespace is simply one more valid namespace). Zero-length namespace string is assumed equal to unspecified namespace.

        commit [commit](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit) object. It does
        not necessarily have to be a hash; it can simply define a [revision

        which is an integer that is monotonically increasing. In cases where
        it is identical to the `ref.head.name`, it SHOULD still be included.
        It is up to the implementer to decide which value to set as the
        revision based on the VCS system and situational context.

        SHOULD include the [application root](/docs/http/http-spans.md#http-server-definitions) if there is one.

        A static path segment is a part of the route template with a fixed, low-cardinality value. This includes literal strings like `/users/` and placeholders that
        are constrained to a finite, predefined set of values, e.g. `{controller}` or `{action}`.

        A dynamic path segment is a placeholder for a value that can have high cardinality and is not constrained to a predefined list like static path segments.

        Instrumentations SHOULD use routing information provided by the corresponding web framework. They SHOULD pick the most precise source of routing information and MAY
        support custom route formatting. Instrumentations SHOULD document the format and the API used to obtain the route string.

      note: |
        Semantic conventions for individual database systems SHOULD document whether `network.peer.*` attributes are applicable. Network peer address and port are useful when the application interacts with individual database nodes directly.
        If a database operation involved multiple network calls (for example retries), the address of the last contacted node SHOULD be used.

      note: |
        If a database system has multiple namespace components, they SHOULD be concatenated from the most general to the most specific namespace component, using `|` as a separator between the components. Any missing components (and their associated separators) SHOULD be omitted.
        Semantic conventions for individual database systems SHOULD document what `db.namespace` means in the context of that system.
        It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application without attempting to do any case normalization.

      note: |
        For sanitization see [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](/docs/db/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).
        For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same query text then that query text SHOULD be used, otherwise all of the individual query texts SHOULD be concatenated with separator `; ` or some other database system specific separator if more applicable.
        Parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be sanitized. Even though parameterized query text can potentially have sensitive data, by using a parameterized query the user is giving a strong signal that any sensitive data will be passed as parameter values, and the benefit to observability of capturing the static part of the query text by default outweighs the risk.

      brief: The Generative AI provider as identified by the client or server instrumentation.
      note: |
        The attribute SHOULD be set based on the instrumentation's best
        knowledge and may differ from the actual model provider.

        Multiple providers, including Azure OpenAI, Gemini, and AI hosting platforms
        are accessible using the OpenAI REST API and corresponding client libraries,
        but may proxy or host models from different providers.

        The `gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.response.model`, and `server.address`
        attributes may help identify the actual system in use.

        The `gen_ai.provider.name` attribute acts as a discriminator that
        identifies the GenAI telemetry format flavor specific to that provider
        within GenAI semantic conventions.
        It SHOULD be set consistently with provider-specific attributes and signals.
        For example, GenAI spans, metrics, and events related to AWS Bedrock
        should have the `gen_ai.provider.name` set to `aws.bedrock` and include
        applicable `aws.bedrock.*` attributes and are not expected to include

      brief: The Generative AI provider as identified by the client or server instrumentation.
      note: |
        The attribute SHOULD be set based on the instrumentation's best
        knowledge and may differ from the actual model provider.

        Multiple providers, including Azure OpenAI, Gemini, and AI hosting platforms
        are accessible using the OpenAI REST API and corresponding client libraries,
        but may proxy or host models from different providers.

        The `gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.response.model`, and `server.address`
        attributes may help identify the actual system in use.

        The `gen_ai.provider.name` attribute acts as a discriminator that
        identifies the GenAI telemetry format flavor specific to that provider
        within GenAI semantic conventions.
        It SHOULD be set consistently with provider-specific attributes and signals.
        For example, GenAI spans, metrics, and events related to AWS Bedrock
        should have the `gen_ai.provider.name` set to `aws.bedrock` and include
        applicable `aws.bedrock.*` attributes and are not expected to include
        `openai.*` attributes.

        HTTP request method value SHOULD be "known" to the instrumentation.

        If the HTTP request method is not known to instrumentation, it MUST set the `http.request.method` attribute to `_OTHER`.

        If the HTTP instrumentation could end up converting valid HTTP request methods to `_OTHER`, then it MUST provide a way to override
        the list of known HTTP methods. If this override is done via environment variable, then the environment variable MUST be named
        OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_HTTP_KNOWN_METHODS and support a comma-separated list of case-sensitive known HTTP methods
        (this list MUST be a full override of the default known method, it is not a list of known methods in addition to the defaults).

        HTTP method names are case-sensitive and `http.request.method` attribute value MUST match a known HTTP method name exactly.
        Instrumentations for specific web frameworks that consider HTTP methods to be case insensitive, SHOULD populate a canonical equivalent.

      brief: HTTP request method.
      note: |
        HTTP request method value SHOULD be "known" to the instrumentation.
        By default, this convention defines "known" methods as the ones listed in [RFC9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-methods),
        the PATCH method defined in [RFC5789](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789.html)
        and the QUERY method defined in [httpbis-safe-method-w-body](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpbis-safe-method-w-body/?include_text=1).

        If the HTTP request method is not known to instrumentation, it MUST set the `http.request.method` attribute to `_OTHER`.

        If the HTTP instrumentation could end up converting valid HTTP request methods to `_OTHER`, then it MUST provide a way to override
        the list of known HTTP methods. If this override is done via environment variable, then the environment variable MUST be named
        OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_HTTP_KNOWN_METHODS and support a comma-separated list of case-sensitive known HTTP methods
        (this list MUST be a full override of the default known method, it is not a list of known methods in addition to the defaults).

        HTTP method names are case-sensitive and `http.request.method` attribute value MUST match a known HTTP method name exactly.
        Instrumentations for specific web frameworks that consider HTTP methods to be case insensitive, SHOULD populate a canonical equivalent.
        Tracing instrumentations that do so, MUST also set `http.request.method_original` to the original value.

        A static path segment is a part of the route template with a fixed, low-cardinality value. This includes literal strings like `/users/` and placeholders that
        are constrained to a finite, predefined set of values, e.g. `{controller}` or `{action}`.

        A dynamic path segment is a placeholder for a value that can have high cardinality and is not constrained to a predefined list like static path segments.

        Instrumentations SHOULD use routing information provided by the corresponding web framework. They SHOULD pick the most precise source of routing information and MAY
        support custom route formatting. Instrumentations SHOULD document the format and the API used to obtain the route string.

        Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

        The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low, but
        telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
        should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time, when no
        additional filters are applied.

      brief: HTTP request method.
      note: |
        HTTP request method value SHOULD be "known" to the instrumentation.
        By default, this convention defines "known" methods as the ones listed in [RFC9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-methods),
        the PATCH method defined in [RFC5789](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789.html)
        and the QUERY method defined in [httpbis-safe-method-w-body](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpbis-safe-method-w-body/?include_text=1).

        If the HTTP request method is not known to instrumentation, it MUST set the `http.request.method` attribute to `_OTHER`.

        If the HTTP instrumentation could end up converting valid HTTP request methods to `_OTHER`, then it MUST provide a way to override
        the list of known HTTP methods. If this override is done via environment variable, then the environment variable MUST be named
        OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_HTTP_KNOWN_METHODS and support a comma-separated list of case-sensitive known HTTP methods
        (this list MUST be a full override of the default known method, it is not a list of known methods in addition to the defaults).

        HTTP method names are case-sensitive and `http.request.method` attribute value MUST match a known HTTP method name exactly.
        Instrumentations for specific web frameworks that consider HTTP methods to be case insensitive, SHOULD populate a canonical equivalent.
        Tracing instrumentations that do so, MUST also set `http.request.method_original` to the original value.

        The matched route template for the request. This MUST be low-cardinality and include all static path segments, with dynamic path segments represented with placeholders.
      note: |
        MUST NOT be populated when this is not supported by the HTTP server framework as the route attribute should have low-cardinality and the URI path can NOT substitute it.
        SHOULD include the [application root](/docs/http/http-spans.md#http-server-definitions) if there is one.

        A static path segment is a part of the route template with a fixed, low-cardinality value. This includes literal strings like `/users/` and placeholders that
        are constrained to a finite, predefined set of values, e.g. `{controller}` or `{action}`.

        A dynamic path segment is a placeholder for a value that can have high cardinality and is not constrained to a predefined list like static path segments.

        Instrumentations SHOULD use routing information provided by the corresponding web framework. They SHOULD pick the most precise source of routing information and MAY
        support custom route formatting. Instrumentations SHOULD document the format and the API used to obtain the route string.

      note: |
        If the request fails with an error before response status code was sent or received,
        `error.type` SHOULD be set to exception type (its fully-qualified class name, if applicable)
        or a component-specific low cardinality error identifier.

        If response status code was sent or received and status indicates an error according to [HTTP span status definition](/docs/http/http-spans.md),
        `error.type` SHOULD be set to the status code number (represented as a string), an exception type (if thrown) or a component-specific error identifier.

        The `error.type` value SHOULD be predictable and SHOULD have low cardinality.
        Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

        The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low, but
        telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
        should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time, when no
        additional filters are applied.

        If the request has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

    note: |
      `hw.status` is currently specified as an *UpDownCounter* but would ideally be represented using a [*StateSet* as defined in OpenMetrics](https://github.com/prometheus/OpenMetrics/blob/v1.0.0/specification/OpenMetrics.md#stateset). This semantic convention will be updated once *StateSet* is specified in OpenTelemetry. This planned change is not expected to have any consequence on the way users query their timeseries backend to retrieve the values of `hw.status` over time.

      either == 0, in which case you can conclude there were no restarts in the recent past, or > 0, in which case
      you can conclude there were restarts in the recent past, and not try and analyze the value beyond that.

        The value for this attribute can be either the full `count/<resource>[.<group>]` string (e.g., count/deployments.apps, count/pods), or, for certain core Kubernetes resources, just the resource name (e.g., pods, services, configmaps). Both forms are supported by Kubernetes for object count quotas.

      note: |
        Starting from .NET 9, Kestrel `kestrel.connection.duration` metric reports
        the following errors types when a corresponding error occurs:

        | Value | Description |
        | --- | --- |
        | `aborted_by_app` | The HTTP/1.1 connection was aborted when app code aborted an HTTP request with `HttpContext.Abort()`. |
        | `app_shutdown_timeout` | The connection was aborted during app shutdown. During shutdown, the server stops accepting new connections and HTTP requests, and it is given time for active requests to complete. If the app shutdown timeout is exceeded, all remaining connections are aborted. |
        | `closed_critical_stream` | A critical control stream for an HTTP/3 connection was closed. |
        | `connection_reset` | The connection was reset while there were active HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 streams on the connection. |
        | `error_after_starting_response` | An error such as an unhandled application exception or invalid request body occurred after the response was started, causing an abort of the HTTP/1.1 connection. |
        | `error_reading_headers` | An error occurred when decoding HPACK headers in an HTTP/2 `HEADERS` frame. |
        | `error_writing_headers` | An error occurred when encoding HPACK headers in an HTTP/2 `HEADERS` frame. |
        | `flow_control_queue_size_exceeded` | The connection exceeded the outgoing flow control maximum queue size and was closed with `INTERNAL_ERROR`. This can be caused by an excessive number of HTTP/2 stream resets. For more information, see [Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2023-44487](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/93303). |
        | `flow_control_window_exceeded` | The client sent more data than allowed by the current flow-control window. |
        | `frame_after_stream_close` | An HTTP/2 frame was received on a closed stream. |
        | `insufficient_tls_version` | The connection doesn't have TLS 1.2 or greater, as required by HTTP/2. |
        | `invalid_body_reader_state` | An error occurred when draining the request body, aborting the HTTP/1.1 connection. This could be caused by app code reading the request body and missing a call to `PipeReader.AdvanceTo` in a finally block. |
        | `invalid_data_padding` | An HTTP/2 `HEADER` or `DATA` frame has an invalid amount of padding. |
        | `invalid_frame_length` | An HTTP/2 frame was received with an invalid frame payload length. The frame could contain a payload that is not valid for the type, or a `DATA` frame payload does not match the length specified in the frame header. |
        | `invalid_handshake` | An invalid HTTP/2 handshake was received. |
        | `invalid_http_version` | The connection received an HTTP request with the wrong version. For example, a browser sends an HTTP/1.1 request to a plain-text HTTP/2 connection. |
        | `invalid_request_headers` | The HTTP request contains invalid headers. This error can occur in a number of scenarios: a header might not be allowed by the HTTP protocol, such as a pseudo-header in the `HEADERS` frame of an HTTP/2 request. A header could also have an invalid value, such as a non-integer `content-length`, or a header name or value might contain invalid characters. |
        | `invalid_request_line` | The first line of an HTTP/1.1 request was invalid, potentially due to invalid content or exceeding the allowed limit. Configured by `KestrelServerLimits.MaxRequestLineSize`. |
        | `invalid_settings` | The connection received an HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 `SETTINGS` frame with invalid settings. |
        | `invalid_stream_id` | An HTTP/2 stream with an invalid stream ID was received. |
        | `invalid_window_update_size` | The server received an HTTP/2 `WINDOW_UPDATE` frame with a zero increment, or an increment that caused a flow-control window to exceed the maximum size. |
        | `io_error` | An `IOException` occurred while reading or writing HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 connection data. |
        | `keep_alive_timeout` | There was no activity on the connection, and the keep-alive timeout configured by `KestrelServerLimits.KeepAliveTimeout` was exceeded. |
        | `max_concurrent_connections_exceeded` | The connection exceeded the maximum concurrent connection limit. Configured by `KestrelServerLimits.MaxConcurrentConnections`. |
        | `max_frame_length_exceeded` | The connection received an HTTP/2 frame that exceeded the size limit specified by `Http2Limits.MaxFrameSize`. |
        | `max_request_body_size_exceeded` | The HTTP request body exceeded the maximum request body size limit. Configured by `KestrelServerLimits.MaxRequestBodySize`. |
        | `max_request_header_count_exceeded` | The HTTP request headers exceeded the maximum count limit. Configured by `KestrelServerLimits.MaxRequestHeaderCount`. |
        | `max_request_headers_total_size_exceeded` | The HTTP request headers exceeded the maximum total size limit. Configured by `KestrelServerLimits.MaxRequestHeadersTotalSize`. |
        | `min_request_body_data_rate` | Reading the request body timed out due to data arriving too slowly. Configured by `KestrelServerLimits.MinRequestBodyDataRate`. |
        | `min_response_data_rate` | Writing the response timed out because the client did not read it at the specified minimum data rate. Configured by `KestrelServerLimits.MinResponseDataRate`. |
        | `missing_stream_end` | The connection received an HTTP/2 `HEADERS` frame for trailers without a stream end flag. |
        | `output_queue_size_exceeded` | The connection exceeded the output queue size and was closed with `INTERNAL_ERROR`. This can be caused by an excessive number of HTTP/2 stream resets. For more information, see [Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2023-44487](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/93303). |
        | `request_headers_timeout` | Request headers timed out while waiting for headers to be received after the request started. Configured by `KestrelServerLimits.RequestHeadersTimeout`. |
        | `response_content_length_mismatch` | The HTTP response body sent data that didn't match the response's `content-length` header. |
        | `server_timeout` | The connection timed out with the `IConnectionTimeoutFeature`. |
        | `stream_creation_error` | The HTTP/3 connection received a stream that it wouldn't accept. For example, the client created duplicate control streams. |
        | `stream_reset_limit_exceeded` | The connection received an excessive number of HTTP/2 stream resets and was closed with `ENHANCE_YOUR_CALM`. For more information, see [Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2023-44487](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/93303). |
        | `stream_self_dependency` | The connection received an HTTP/2 frame that caused a frame to depend on itself. |
        | `tls_handshake_failed` | An error occurred during the TLS handshake for a connection. Only reported for HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 connections. The TLS handshake for HTTP/3 is internal to QUIC transport. ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
        | `tls_not_supported` | A TLS handshake was received by an endpoint that isn't configured to support TLS. |
        | `unexpected_end_of_request_content` | The HTTP/1.1 request body ended before the data specified by the `content-length` header or chunked transfer encoding mechanism was received. |
        | `unexpected_frame` | An unexpected HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 frame type was received. The frame type is either unknown, unsupported, or invalid for the current stream state. |
        | `unknown_stream` | An HTTP/2 frame was received on an unknown stream. |
        | `write_canceled` | The cancellation of a response body write aborted the HTTP/1.1 connection. |

        Describes a class of error the operation ended with.
      note: |
        The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

        When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
        canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

        Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

        The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
        Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
        should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
        additional filters are applied.

        If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

        If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
        it's RECOMMENDED to:

        - Use a domain-specific attribute

        Describes a class of error the operation ended with.
      note: |
        The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

        When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
        canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

        Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

        The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
        Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
        should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
        additional filters are applied.

        If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

        If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
        it's RECOMMENDED to:

        - Use a domain-specific attribute
        - Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

      brief: |
        Describes a class of error the operation ended with.
      note: |
        The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

        When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
        canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

        Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

        The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
        Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
        should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
        additional filters are applied.

        If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

        If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
        it's RECOMMENDED to:

        - Use a domain-specific attribute
        - Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

      brief: |
        A name uniquely identifying the instance of the OpenTelemetry component within its containing SDK instance.
      note: |
        Implementations SHOULD ensure a low cardinality for this attribute, even across application or SDK restarts.
        E.g. implementations MUST NOT use UUIDs as values for this attribute.

        Implementations MAY achieve these goals by following a `<otel.component.type>/<instance-counter>` pattern, e.g. `batching_span_processor/0`.
        Hereby `otel.component.type` refers to the corresponding attribute value of the component.

        The value of `instance-counter` MAY be automatically assigned by the component and uniqueness within the enclosing SDK instance MUST be guaranteed.
        For example, `<instance-counter>` MAY be implemented by using a monotonically increasing counter (starting with `0`), which is incremented every time an
        instance of the given component type is started.

        With this implementation, for example the first Batching Span Processor would have `batching_span_processor/0`
        as `otel.component.name`, the second one `batching_span_processor/1` and so on.
        These values will therefore be reused in the case of an application restart.

          brief: |
            A fallback error value to be used when the instrumentation doesn't define a custom value.

      - rejected

      - java.net.UnknownHostException
      brief: |
        Describes a class of error the operation ended with.
      note: |
        The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

        When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
        canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

        Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

        The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
        Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
        should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
        additional filters are applied.

        If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

        If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
        it's RECOMMENDED to:

        - Use a domain-specific attribute
        - Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.
      stability: stable
      requirement_level: recommended
    brief: The number of log records for which the export has finished, either successful or failed.
    note: |
      For successful exports, `error.type` MUST NOT be set. For failed exports, `error.type` MUST contain the failure cause.
      For exporters with partial success semantics (e.g. OTLP with `rejected_log_records`), rejected log records MUST count as failed and only non-rejected log records count as success.
      If no rejection reason is available, `rejected` SHOULD be used as value for `error.type`.

        E.g. implementations MUST NOT use UUIDs as values for this attribute.

        The value of `instance-counter` MAY be automatically assigned by the component and uniqueness within the enclosing SDK instance MUST be guaranteed.
        For example, `<instance-counter>` MAY be implemented by using a monotonically increasing counter (starting with `0`), which is incremented every time an
        instance of the given component type is started.

        With this implementation, for example the first Batching Span Processor would have `batching_span_processor/0`

      brief: |
        Describes a class of error the operation ended with.
      note: |
        The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

        When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
        canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

        Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

        The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
        Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
        should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
        additional filters are applied.

        If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

        If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
        it's RECOMMENDED to:

        - Use a domain-specific attribute
        - Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

    note: |
      For successful exports, `error.type` MUST NOT be set. For failed exports, `error.type` MUST contain the failure cause.
      For exporters with partial success semantics (e.g. OTLP with `rejected_data_points`), rejected data points MUST count as failed and only non-rejected data points count as success.
      If no rejection reason is available, `rejected` SHOULD be used as value for `error.type`.

      brief: |
        Describes a class of error the operation ended with.
      note: |
        The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

        When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
        canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

        Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

        The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
        Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
        should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
        additional filters are applied.

        If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

        If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
        it's RECOMMENDED to:

        - Use a domain-specific attribute
        - Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

      brief: |
        A name uniquely identifying the instance of the OpenTelemetry component within its containing SDK instance.
      note: |
        Implementations SHOULD ensure a low cardinality for this attribute, even across application or SDK restarts.
        E.g. implementations MUST NOT use UUIDs as values for this attribute.

        Implementations MAY achieve these goals by following a `<otel.component.type>/<instance-counter>` pattern, e.g. `batching_span_processor/0`.
        Hereby `otel.component.type` refers to the corresponding attribute value of the component.

        The value of `instance-counter` MAY be automatically assigned by the component and uniqueness within the enclosing SDK instance MUST be guaranteed.
        For example, `<instance-counter>` MAY be implemented by using a monotonically increasing counter (starting with `0`), which is incremented every time an
        instance of the given component type is started.

        With this implementation, for example the first Batching Span Processor would have `batching_span_processor/0`
        as `otel.component.name`, the second one `batching_span_processor/1` and so on.
        These values will therefore be reused in the case of an application restart.

        Describes a class of error the operation ended with.
      note: |
        The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

        When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
        canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

        Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

        The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
        Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
        should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
        additional filters are applied.

        If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

        If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
        it's RECOMMENDED to:

        - Use a domain-specific attribute
        - Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

        A name uniquely identifying the instance of the OpenTelemetry component within its containing SDK instance.
      note: |
        Implementations SHOULD ensure a low cardinality for this attribute, even across application or SDK restarts.
        E.g. implementations MUST NOT use UUIDs as values for this attribute.

        Implementations MAY achieve these goals by following a `<otel.component.type>/<instance-counter>` pattern, e.g. `batching_span_processor/0`.
        Hereby `otel.component.type` refers to the corresponding attribute value of the component.

        The value of `instance-counter` MAY be automatically assigned by the component and uniqueness within the enclosing SDK instance MUST be guaranteed.
        For example, `<instance-counter>` MAY be implemented by using a monotonically increasing counter (starting with `0`), which is incremented every time an
        instance of the given component type is started.

        With this implementation, for example the first Batching Span Processor would have `batching_span_processor/0`

        For example, `<instance-counter>` MAY be implemented by using a monotonically increasing counter (starting with `0`), which is incremented every time an
        instance of the given component type is started.

        With this implementation, for example the first Batching Span Processor would have `batching_span_processor/0`
        as `otel.component.name`, the second one `batching_span_processor/1` and so on.
        These values will therefore be reused in the case of an application restart.

      brief: |
        A low-cardinality description of the failure reason. SDK Batching Span Processors MUST use `queue_full` for spans dropped due to a full queue.
      note: |
        The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

        When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
        canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

        Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

        The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
        Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
        should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
        additional filters are applied.

        If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

        If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
        it's RECOMMENDED to:

        - Use a domain-specific attribute
        - Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

      brief: |
        A name uniquely identifying the instance of the OpenTelemetry component within its containing SDK instance.
      note: |
        Implementations SHOULD ensure a low cardinality for this attribute, even across application or SDK restarts.
        E.g. implementations MUST NOT use UUIDs as values for this attribute.

        Implementations MAY achieve these goals by following a `<otel.component.type>/<instance-counter>` pattern, e.g. `batching_span_processor/0`.
        Hereby `otel.component.type` refers to the corresponding attribute value of the component.

        The value of `instance-counter` MAY be automatically assigned by the component and uniqueness within the enclosing SDK instance MUST be guaranteed.
        For example, `<instance-counter>` MAY be implemented by using a monotonically increasing counter (starting with `0`), which is incremented every time an
        instance of the given component type is started.

        With this implementation, for example the first Batching Span Processor would have `batching_span_processor/0`
        as `otel.component.name`, the second one `batching_span_processor/1` and so on.
        These values will therefore be reused in the case of an application restart.

        If the RPC fails with an error before status code is returned,

        or a component-specific, low cardinality error identifier.

        If a response status code is returned and status indicates an error,
        `error.type` SHOULD be set to that status code. Check system-specific conventions
        for the details on which values of `rpc.response.status_code` are considered errors.

        The `error.type` value SHOULD be predictable and SHOULD have low cardinality.

        If the RPC fails with an error before status code is returned,
        `error.type` SHOULD be set to the exception type (its fully-qualified class name, if applicable)
        or a component-specific, low cardinality error identifier.

        If a response status code is returned and status indicates an error,
        `error.type` SHOULD be set to that status code. Check system-specific conventions
        for the details on which values of `rpc.response.status_code` are considered errors.

        The `error.type` value SHOULD be predictable and SHOULD have low cardinality.
        Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

        If the request has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set

    brief: An estimate of how much memory is available for starting new applications, without causing swapping.
    note: |
      This is an alternative to `system.memory.usage` metric with `state=free`.
      Linux starting from 3.14 exports "available" memory. It takes "free" memory as a baseline, and then factors in kernel-specific values.
      This is supposed to be more accurate than just "free" memory.
      For reference, see the calculations [here](https://superuser.com/a/980821).
      See also `MemAvailable` in [/proc/meminfo](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc.5.html).

      The sum over the `reclaimable` and `unreclaimable` state values in `memory.linux.slab.usage` SHOULD be equal to the total slab memory available on the system.
      Note that the total slab memory is not constant and may vary over time.

      brief: The list of source system tool definitions available to the GenAI agent or model.
      note: |
        The value of this attribute matches source system tool definition format.

        It's expected to be an array of objects where each object represents a tool definition. In case a serialized string is available
        to the instrumentation, the instrumentation SHOULD do the best effort to
        deserialize it to an array. When recorded on spans, it MAY be recorded as a JSON string if structured format is not supported and SHOULD be recorded in structured form otherwise.

        Since this attribute could be large, it's NOT RECOMMENDED to populate
        it by default. Instrumentations MAY provide a way to enable
        populating this attribute.

      brief: The Generative AI provider as identified by the client or server instrumentation.
      note: |
        The attribute SHOULD be set based on the instrumentation's best
        knowledge and may differ from the actual model provider.

        Multiple providers, including Azure OpenAI, Gemini, and AI hosting platforms
        are accessible using the OpenAI REST API and corresponding client libraries,
        but may proxy or host models from different providers.

        The `gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.response.model`, and `server.address`
        attributes may help identify the actual system in use.

        The `gen_ai.provider.name` attribute acts as a discriminator that
        identifies the GenAI telemetry format flavor specific to that provider
        within GenAI semantic conventions.
        It SHOULD be set consistently with provider-specific attributes and signals.
        For example, GenAI spans, metrics, and events related to AWS Bedrock
        should have the `gen_ai.provider.name` set to `aws.bedrock` and include
        applicable `aws.bedrock.*` attributes and are not expected to include
        `openai.*` attributes.

      **Span name** MUST be of the format `Service.Operation` as per the
      AWS HTTP API, e.g., `DynamoDB.GetItem`, `S3.ListBuckets`. This is
      equivalent to concatenating `rpc.service` and `rpc.method` with `.` and
      consistent with the naming guidelines for RPC client spans.

      AWS SDK span attributes are based on the request or response parameters
      in AWS SDK API calls. The conventions have been collected over time based
      on feedback from AWS users of tracing and will continue to increase as new
      interesting conventions are found.

      note: |
        For sanitization see [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](/docs/db/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).
        For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same query text then that query text SHOULD be used, otherwise all of the individual query texts SHOULD be concatenated with separator `; ` or some other database system specific separator if more applicable.
        Parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be sanitized. Even though parameterized query text can potentially have sensitive data, by using a parameterized query the user is giving a strong signal that any sensitive data will be passed as parameter values, and the benefit to observability of capturing the static part of the query text by default outweighs the risk.

        Bulk operations:

        - `execute_bulk` SHOULD be used on spans reported for methods like

          which represents a bulk execution of multiple operations.
        - `bulk_{operation name}` (`bulk_create_item`, `bulk_upsert_item`, etc) SHOULD be used on spans describing individual operations (when they are reported)
          within the bulk. This pattern SHOULD be used when instrumentation creates span per each operation, but operations are buffered and then performed in bulk.
          For example, this applies when [`AllowBulkExecution`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cosmos.cosmosclientoptions.allowbulkexecution)
          property is configured on the `Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos` client.

        Describes a class of error the operation ended with.
      note: |
        The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

        When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
        canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

        Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

        The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
        Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
        should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
        additional filters are applied.

        If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

        If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
        it's RECOMMENDED to:

        - Use a domain-specific attribute
        - Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

    brief: This span describes database client call.
    note: |
      Instrumentations SHOULD, when possible, record database spans that cover the duration of
      the corresponding API call as if it was observed by the caller (such as client application).
      For example, if a transient issue happened and was retried within this database call, the corresponding
      span should cover the duration of the logical operation with all retries.

      When a database client provides higher-level convenience APIs for specific operations
      (e.g., calling a stored procedure), which internally generate and execute a generic query,
      it is RECOMMENDED to instrument the higher-level convenience APIs.
      These often allow setting `db.operation.*` attributes, which usually are not
      readily available at the generic query level.

      **Span name** is covered in the [Name](/docs/db/database-spans.md#name) section.

      **Span kind** SHOULD be `CLIENT`. It MAY be set to `INTERNAL` on spans representing
      in-memory database calls.
      It's RECOMMENDED to use `CLIENT` kind when database system being instrumented usually
      runs in a different process than its client or when database calls happen over
      instrumented protocol such as HTTP.

      **Span status** SHOULD follow the [Recording Errors](/docs/general/recording-errors.md) document.
      Semantic conventions for individual systems SHOULD specify which values of `db.response.status_code`
      classify as errors.

        HTTP request method value SHOULD be "known" to the instrumentation.
        By default, this convention defines "known" methods as the ones listed in [RFC9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-methods),
        the PATCH method defined in [RFC5789](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789.html)
        and the QUERY method defined in [httpbis-safe-method-w-body](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpbis-safe-method-w-body/?include_text=1).

        If the HTTP request method is not known to instrumentation, it MUST set the `http.request.method` attribute to `_OTHER`.

        If the HTTP instrumentation could end up converting valid HTTP request methods to `_OTHER`, then it MUST provide a way to override
        the list of known HTTP methods. If this override is done via environment variable, then the environment variable MUST be named
        OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_HTTP_KNOWN_METHODS and support a comma-separated list of case-sensitive known HTTP methods
        (this list MUST be a full override of the default known method, it is not a list of known methods in addition to the defaults).

        HTTP method names are case-sensitive and `http.request.method` attribute value MUST match a known HTTP method name exactly.
        Instrumentations for specific web frameworks that consider HTTP methods to be case insensitive, SHOULD populate a canonical equivalent.
        Tracing instrumentations that do so, MUST also set `http.request.method_original` to the original value.

        For network calls, URL usually has `scheme://host[:port][path][?query][#fragment]` format, where the fragment
        is not transmitted over HTTP, but if it is known, it SHOULD be included nevertheless.

        `url.full` MUST NOT contain credentials passed via URL in form of `https://username:password@www.example.com/`.
        In such case username and password SHOULD be redacted and attribute's value SHOULD be `https://REDACTED:REDACTED@www.example.com/`.

        `url.full` SHOULD capture the absolute URL when it is available (or can be reconstructed).

        Sensitive content provided in `url.full` SHOULD be scrubbed when instrumentations can identify it.

        ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)
        Query string values for the following keys SHOULD be redacted by default and replaced by the
        value `REDACTED`:

        This list is subject to change over time.

      note: |
        If a query parameter has no name and instead is referenced only by index,

      note: |
        The query summary describes a class of database queries and is useful

        calls involving complex queries.

        Summary may be available to the instrumentation through
        instrumentation hooks or other means. If it is not available, instrumentations
        that support query parsing SHOULD generate a summary following

      note: |
        For sanitization see [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](/docs/db/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).
        For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same query text then that query text SHOULD be used, otherwise all of the individual query texts SHOULD be concatenated with separator `; ` or some other database system specific separator if more applicable.
        Parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be sanitized. Even though parameterized query text can potentially have sensitive data, by using a parameterized query the user is giving a strong signal that any sensitive data will be passed as parameter values, and the benefit to observability of capturing the static part of the query text by default outweighs the risk.

      note: |
        If a database system has multiple namespace components (e.g. schema name and database name), they SHOULD be concatenated
        from the most general to the most specific namespace component,
        using `|` as a separator between the components.
        Any missing components (and their associated separators) SHOULD be omitted.

        Semantic conventions for individual database systems SHOULD document what `db.namespace`
        means in the context of that system.

        A connection's currently associated database may change during its lifetime, e.g. from executing `USE <database>`.

        If instrumentation is unable to capture the connection's currently associated database on each query

      brief: |
        Database response code recorded as a string.
      note: |
        SQL defines [SQLSTATE](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLSTATE) as a database
        return code which is adopted by some database systems like PostgreSQL.
        See [PostgreSQL error codes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/errcodes-appendix.html)
        for the details.

        Other systems like MySQL, Oracle, or MS SQL Server define vendor-specific
        error codes. Database SQL drivers usually provide access to both properties.
        For example, in Java, the [`SQLException`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/sql/SQLException.html)
        class reports them with `getSQLState()` and `getErrorCode()` methods.

        Instrumentations SHOULD populate the `db.response.status_code` with the
        the most specific code available to them.

        Here's a non-exhaustive list of databases that report vendor-specific
        codes with granularity higher than SQLSTATE (or don't report SQLSTATE
        at all):

        - [DB2 SQL codes](https://www.ibm.com/docs/db2-for-zos/12?topic=codes-sql).
        - [Maria DB error codes](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-error-code-reference/)
        - [Microsoft SQL Server errors](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/errors-events/database-engine-events-and-errors)
        - [MySQL error codes](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/9.0/en/error-reference-introduction.html)
        - [Oracle error codes](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28278/toc.htm)
        - [SQLite result codes](https://www.sqlite.org/rescode.html)

        These systems SHOULD set the `db.response.status_code` to a
        known vendor-specific error code. If only SQLSTATE is available,
        it SHOULD be used.

        When multiple error codes are available and specificity is unclear,
        instrumentation SHOULD set the `db.response.status_code` to the
        concatenated string of all codes with '/' used as a separator.

        For example, generic DB instrumentation that detected an error and has
        SQLSTATE `"42000"` and vendor-specific `1071` should set
        `db.response.status_code` to `"42000/1071"`."

      The following database systems (defined in the
      [`db.system.name`](/docs/db/database-spans.md#notes-and-well-known-identifiers-for-dbsystemname) set)

        A database query parameter, with `<key>` being the parameter name, and the attribute value being a string representation of the parameter value.
      note: |
        If a query parameter has no name and instead is referenced only by index,

        up with the parameterized placeholders present in `db.query.text`.

        It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application
        without attempting to do any case normalization.

        `db.query.parameter.<key>` SHOULD NOT be captured on batch operations.

        - For a query `SELECT * FROM users where username =  %s` with the parameter `"jdoe"`,
          the attribute `db.query.parameter.0` SHOULD be set to `"jdoe"`.

        - For a query `"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %(userName)s;` with parameter

      note: |
        The query summary describes a class of database queries and is useful

        that support query parsing SHOULD generate a summary following

      note: |
        For sanitization see [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](/docs/db/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).
        For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same query text then that query text SHOULD be used, otherwise all of the individual query texts SHOULD be concatenated with separator `; ` or some other database system specific separator if more applicable.
        Parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be sanitized. Even though parameterized query text can potentially have sensitive data, by using a parameterized query the user is giving a strong signal that any sensitive data will be passed as parameter values, and the benefit to observability of capturing the static part of the query text by default outweighs the risk.

        A connection's currently associated database may change during its lifetime, e.g. from executing `USE <database>`.

        If instrumentation is unable to capture the connection's currently associated database on each query
        without triggering an additional query to be executed (e.g. `SELECT DB_NAME()`),
        then it is RECOMMENDED to fallback and use the database provided when the connection was established.

      The span describes DNS lookup or reverse lookup performed with one of the methods on [System.Net.Dns](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.net.dns) class.
    note: |
      DNS spans track logical operations rather than physical DNS calls and the actual behavior depends on the
      resolver implementation which could be changed in the future versions of .NET.
      .NET 9 uses OS DNS resolver which may do zero or more physical lookups for one API call.

      When the *DNS lookup* span is reported along with *HTTP connection setup* and *socket connect* span,
      the *DNS lookup* span span becomes a child of *HTTP connection setup* and a sibling of *socket connect*.

      DNS lookup duration is also reported by [`dns.lookup.duration` metric](/docs/dotnet/dotnet-dns-metrics.md#metric-dnslookupduration).

      Corresponding `Activity.OperationName` is `Experimental.System.Net.NameResolution.DnsLookup`, `ActivitySource` name - `Experimental.System.Net.NameResolution`.
      Added in .NET 9.

      **Span name** SHOULD be `DNS lookup {dns.question.name}` for DNS lookup (IP addresses from host name)
      and `DNS reverse lookup {dns.question.name}` for reverse lookup (host names from IP address).

      the latter will always be a root span, defining a separate trace.

      However, if the connection attempt represented by the [*HTTP connection setup*](/docs/dotnet/dotnet-network-traces.md#http-connection-setup) span results in a
      successful HTTP connection, and that connection is picked up by a request to serve it, the instrumentation adds a link
      to the [*HTTP client request*](/docs/dotnet/dotnet-network-traces.md#http-client-request) span pointing to the *HTTP connection setup* span.
      I.e., each request is linked to the connection that served this request.

      It's reported as a child of *HTTP client request* span.

      The span ends when the connection is obtained - it could happen when an existing connection becomes available or once

    brief: |
      The span describes TLS client or server handshake performed with [System.Net.Security.SslStream](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.net.security.sslstream).
    note: |
      When *TLS* span is reported for client-side authentication along with *HTTP connection setup* and *socket connect* span, the *TLS* span becomes a child of *HTTP connection setup*.

      Corresponding `Activity.OperationName` is `Experimental.System.Net.Security.TlsHandshake`, `ActivitySource` name - `Experimental.System.Net.Security`.
      Added in .NET 9.

      **Span name** SHOULD be `TLS client handshake {server.address}` when authenticating on the client
      side and `TLS server handshake` when authenticating the server.

      **Span kind** SHOULD be `INTERNAL` in both cases.

      brief: The Generative AI provider as identified by the client or server instrumentation.
      note: |
        The attribute SHOULD be set based on the instrumentation's best
        knowledge and may differ from the actual model provider.

        Multiple providers, including Azure OpenAI, Gemini, and AI hosting platforms
        are accessible using the OpenAI REST API and corresponding client libraries,
        but may proxy or host models from different providers.

        The `gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.response.model`, and `server.address`
        attributes may help identify the actual system in use.

        The `gen_ai.provider.name` attribute acts as a discriminator that
        identifies the GenAI telemetry format flavor specific to that provider
        within GenAI semantic conventions.
        It SHOULD be set consistently with provider-specific attributes and signals.
        For example, GenAI spans, metrics, and events related to AWS Bedrock
        should have the `gen_ai.provider.name` set to `aws.bedrock` and include
        applicable `aws.bedrock.*` attributes and are not expected to include
        `openai.*` attributes.

      brief: The Generative AI provider as identified by the client or server instrumentation.
      note: |
        The attribute SHOULD be set based on the instrumentation's best
        knowledge and may differ from the actual model provider.

        Multiple providers, including Azure OpenAI, Gemini, and AI hosting platforms
        are accessible using the OpenAI REST API and corresponding client libraries,
        but may proxy or host models from different providers.

        The `gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.response.model`, and `server.address`
        attributes may help identify the actual system in use.

        The `gen_ai.provider.name` attribute acts as a discriminator that
        identifies the GenAI telemetry format flavor specific to that provider
        within GenAI semantic conventions.
        It SHOULD be set consistently with provider-specific attributes and signals.
        For example, GenAI spans, metrics, and events related to AWS Bedrock
        should have the `gen_ai.provider.name` set to `aws.bedrock` and include
        applicable `aws.bedrock.*` attributes and are not expected to include
        `openai.*` attributes.

      Semantic conventions for individual GenAI systems and frameworks MAY specify different span name format

      brief: The Generative AI provider as identified by the client or server instrumentation.
      note: |
        The attribute SHOULD be set based on the instrumentation's best
        knowledge and may differ from the actual model provider.

        Multiple providers, including Azure OpenAI, Gemini, and AI hosting platforms
        are accessible using the OpenAI REST API and corresponding client libraries,
        but may proxy or host models from different providers.

        The `gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.response.model`, and `server.address`
        attributes may help identify the actual system in use.

        The `gen_ai.provider.name` attribute acts as a discriminator that
        identifies the GenAI telemetry format flavor specific to that provider
        within GenAI semantic conventions.
        It SHOULD be set consistently with provider-specific attributes and signals.
        For example, GenAI spans, metrics, and events related to AWS Bedrock
        should have the `gen_ai.provider.name` set to `aws.bedrock` and include
        applicable `aws.bedrock.*` attributes and are not expected to include

        Data sources are used by AI agents and RAG applications to store grounding data. A data source may be an external database, object store, document collection, website, or any other storage system used by the GenAI agent or application. The `gen_ai.data_source.id` SHOULD match the identifier used by the GenAI system rather than a name specific to the external storage, such as a database or object store. Semantic conventions referencing `gen_ai.data_source.id` MAY also leverage additional attributes, such as `db.*`, to further identify and describe the data source.

      The `gen_ai.operation.name` SHOULD be `invoke_agent`.

      **Span name** SHOULD be `invoke_agent {gen_ai.agent.name}` if `gen_ai.agent.name` is readily available.
      When `gen_ai.agent.name` is not available, it SHOULD be `invoke_agent`.
      Semantic conventions for individual GenAI systems and frameworks MAY specify different span name format.

      **Span kind** SHOULD be `CLIENT` and MAY be set to `INTERNAL` on spans representing
      invocation of agents running in the same process.
      It's RECOMMENDED to use `CLIENT` kind when the agent being instrumented usually runs
      in a different process than its caller or when the agent invocation happens over
      instrumented protocol such as HTTP.

      Examples of span kinds for different agent scenarios:

      - `CLIENT`: Remote agent services (e.g., OpenAI Assistants API, AWS Bedrock Agents)
      - `INTERNAL`: In-process agents (e.g., LangChain agents, CrewAI agents)

      brief: HTTP request method.
      note: |
        HTTP request method value SHOULD be "known" to the instrumentation.
        By default, this convention defines "known" methods as the ones listed in [RFC9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-methods),
        the PATCH method defined in [RFC5789](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789.html)
        and the QUERY method defined in [httpbis-safe-method-w-body](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpbis-safe-method-w-body/?include_text=1).

        If the HTTP request method is not known to instrumentation, it MUST set the `http.request.method` attribute to `_OTHER`.

        If the HTTP instrumentation could end up converting valid HTTP request methods to `_OTHER`, then it MUST provide a way to override
        the list of known HTTP methods. If this override is done via environment variable, then the environment variable MUST be named
        OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_HTTP_KNOWN_METHODS and support a comma-separated list of case-sensitive known HTTP methods
        (this list MUST be a full override of the default known method, it is not a list of known methods in addition to the defaults).

        HTTP method names are case-sensitive and `http.request.method` attribute value MUST match a known HTTP method name exactly.
        Instrumentations for specific web frameworks that consider HTTP methods to be case insensitive, SHOULD populate a canonical equivalent.
        Tracing instrumentations that do so, MUST also set `http.request.method_original` to the original value.

        or a component-specific low cardinality error identifier.

        If response status code was sent or received and status indicates an error according to [HTTP span status definition](/docs/http/http-spans.md),
        `error.type` SHOULD be set to the status code number (represented as a string), an exception type (if thrown) or a component-specific error identifier.

        The `error.type` value SHOULD be predictable and SHOULD have low cardinality.
        Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

        The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low, but
        telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
        should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time, when no
        additional filters are applied.

        Instrumentations SHOULD require an explicit configuration of which headers are to be captured.

        the HTTP library provides access to headers.

      This span represents an outbound HTTP request.
    note: |
      There are two ways HTTP client spans can be implemented in an instrumentation:

      1. Instrumentations SHOULD create an HTTP span for each attempt to send an HTTP request over the wire.
         In case the request is resent, the resend attempts MUST follow the [HTTP resend spec](#http-request-retries-and-redirects).
         In this case, instrumentations SHOULD NOT (also) emit a logical encompassing HTTP client span.

      2. If for some reason it is not possible to emit a span for each send attempt (because e.g. the instrumented library does not expose hooks that would allow this),
         instrumentations MAY create an HTTP span for the top-most operation of the HTTP client.
         In this case, the `url.full` MUST be the absolute URL that was originally requested, before any HTTP-redirects that may happen when executing the request.

      **Span name:** refer to the [Span Name](/docs/http/http-spans.md#name) section.

      **Span kind** MUST be `CLIENT`.

      **Span status:** refer to the [Span Status](/docs/http/http-spans.md#status) section.

        The matched route template for the request. This MUST be low-cardinality and include all static path segments, with dynamic path segments represented with placeholders.
      note: |
        MUST NOT be populated when this is not supported by the HTTP server framework as the route attribute should have low-cardinality and the URI path can NOT substitute it.
        SHOULD include the [application root](/docs/http/http-spans.md#http-server-definitions) if there is one.

        A static path segment is a part of the route template with a fixed, low-cardinality value. This includes literal strings like `/users/` and placeholders that
        are constrained to a finite, predefined set of values, e.g. `{controller}` or `{action}`.

        A dynamic path segment is a placeholder for a value that can have high cardinality and is not constrained to a predefined list like static path segments.

        Instrumentations SHOULD use routing information provided by the corresponding web framework. They SHOULD pick the most precise source of routing information and MAY
        support custom route formatting. Instrumentations SHOULD document the format and the API used to obtain the route string.

      brief: HTTP request method.
      note: |
        HTTP request method value SHOULD be "known" to the instrumentation.
        By default, this convention defines "known" methods as the ones listed in [RFC9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-methods),
        the PATCH method defined in [RFC5789](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789.html)
        and the QUERY method defined in [httpbis-safe-method-w-body](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpbis-safe-method-w-body/?include_text=1).

        If the HTTP request method is not known to instrumentation, it MUST set the `http.request.method` attribute to `_OTHER`.

        If the HTTP instrumentation could end up converting valid HTTP request methods to `_OTHER`, then it MUST provide a way to override
        the list of known HTTP methods. If this override is done via environment variable, then the environment variable MUST be named
        OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_HTTP_KNOWN_METHODS and support a comma-separated list of case-sensitive known HTTP methods
        (this list MUST be a full override of the default known method, it is not a list of known methods in addition to the defaults).

        HTTP method names are case-sensitive and `http.request.method` attribute value MUST match a known HTTP method name exactly.
        Instrumentations for specific web frameworks that consider HTTP methods to be case insensitive, SHOULD populate a canonical equivalent.
        Tracing instrumentations that do so, MUST also set `http.request.method_original` to the original value.

        `error.type` SHOULD be set to exception type (its fully-qualified class name, if applicable)
        or a component-specific low cardinality error identifier.

        If response status code was sent or received and status indicates an error according to [HTTP span status definition](/docs/http/http-spans.md),
        `error.type` SHOULD be set to the status code number (represented as a string), an exception type (if thrown) or a component-specific error identifier.

        The `error.type` value SHOULD be predictable and SHOULD have low cardinality.
        Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

        The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low, but
        telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
        should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time, when no
        additional filters are applied.

        If the request has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

      RPC client spans SHOULD cover the entire client-side lifecycle of an RPC,

      response streams until they are closed or terminated.

      If a transient issue happened and was retried within this RPC, the corresponding
      span SHOULD cover the duration of the logical call with all retries.

      **Span name:** refer to the [Span Name](/docs/rpc/rpc-spans.md#span-name) section.

      **Span kind** MUST be `CLIENT`.

        With some feature flag providers, feature flag results can be quite large or contain private or sensitive details.
        Because of this, `feature_flag.result.variant` is often the preferred attribute if it is available.

        It may be desirable to redact or otherwise limit the size and scope of `feature_flag.result.value` if possible.
        Because the evaluated flag value is unstructured and may be any type, it is left to the instrumentation author to determine how best to achieve this.

    brief: |
      Defines feature flag evaluation as an event.
    note: |
      A `feature_flag.evaluation` event SHOULD be emitted whenever a feature flag value is evaluated, which may happen many times over the course of an application lifecycle. For example, a website A/B testing different animations may evaluate a flag each time a button is clicked. A `feature_flag.evaluation` event is emitted on each evaluation even if the result is the same.

        [OpenAI Assistant threads](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/threads))

        Application developers that manage conversation history MAY add conversation id to GenAI and other

      brief: Messages returned by the model where each message represents a specific model response (choice, candidate).
      note: |
        Instrumentations MUST follow [Output messages JSON schema](/docs/gen-ai/gen-ai-output-messages.json)

        Each message represents a single output choice/candidate generated by
        the model. Each message corresponds to exactly one generation
        (choice/candidate) and vice versa - one choice cannot be split across
        multiple messages or one message cannot contain parts from multiple choices.

        When the attribute is recorded on events, it MUST be recorded in structured
        form. When recorded on spans, it MAY be recorded as a JSON string if structured
        format is not supported and SHOULD be recorded in structured form otherwise.

        Instrumentations MAY provide a way for users to filter or truncate
        output messages.

        chat history.

        Instructions that are part of the chat history SHOULD be recorded in
        `gen_ai.input.messages` attribute instead.

        Instrumentations MUST follow [System instructions JSON schema](/docs/gen-ai/gen-ai-system-instructions.json).

        When recorded on spans, it MAY be recorded as a JSON string if structured

        It's expected to be an array of objects where each object represents a tool definition. In case a serialized string is available
        to the instrumentation, the instrumentation SHOULD do the best effort to
        deserialize it to an array. When recorded on spans, it MAY be recorded as a JSON string if structured format is not supported and SHOULD be recorded in structured form otherwise.

        Since this attribute could be large, it's NOT RECOMMENDED to populate
        it by default. Instrumentations MAY provide a way to enable
        populating this attribute.

        This attribute provides a human-readable interpretation of the evaluation score produced by an evaluator. For example, a score value of 1 could mean "relevant" in one evaluation system and "not relevant" in another, depending on the scoring range and evaluator. The label SHOULD have low cardinality. Possible values depend on the evaluation metric and evaluator used; implementations SHOULD document the possible values.

      Indicates that a new session has been started, optionally linking to the prior session.
    note: |
      For instrumentation that tracks user behavior during user sessions, a `session.start` event MUST be emitted every time a session is created. When a new session is created as a continuation of a prior session, the `session.previous_id` SHOULD be included in the event. The values of `session.id` and `session.previous_id` MUST be different.
      When the `session.start` event contains both `session.id` and `session.previous_id` fields, the event indicates that the previous session has ended. If the session ID in `session.previous_id` has not yet ended via explicit `session.end` event, then the consumer SHOULD treat this continuation event as semantically equivalent to `session.end(session.previous_id)` and `session.start(session.id)`.
