## Client Attributes

| Attribute | Type | Description | Examples | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a id="client-address" href="#client-address">`client.address`</a> | string | Client address - domain name if available without reverse DNS lookup; otherwise, IP address or Unix domain socket name. [1] | `client.example.com`; `10.1.2.80`; `/tmp/my.sock` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| <a id="client-port" href="#client-port">`client.port`</a> | int | Client port number. [2] | `65123` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |

**[1] `client.address`:** When observed from the server side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `client.address` SHOULD represent the client address behind any intermediaries,  for example proxies, if it's available.

**[2] `client.port`:** When observed from the server side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `client.port` SHOULD represent the client port behind any intermediaries,  for example proxies, if it's available.
