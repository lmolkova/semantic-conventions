**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

This span represents a client call to Generative AI model or service that generates a response or requests a tool call based on the input prompt.

**Span name** SHOULD be `{gen_ai.operation.name} {gen_ai.request.model}`.
Semantic conventions for individual GenAI systems and frameworks MAY specify different span name format
and MUST follow the overall [guidelines for span names](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/v1.37.0/specification/trace/api.md#span).

**Span kind** SHOULD be `CLIENT`and MAY be set to `INTERNAL` on spans representing
call to models running in the same process. It's RECOMMENDED to use `CLIENT` kind
when the GenAI system being instrumented usually runs in a different process than its
client or when the GenAI call happens over instrumented protocol such as HTTP.

**Span status** SHOULD follow the [Recording Errors](/docs/general/recording-errors.md) document.

**[1] `gen_ai.operation.name`:** If one of the predefined values applies, but specific system uses a different name it's RECOMMENDED to document it in the semantic conventions for specific GenAI system and use system-specific name in the instrumentation. If a different name is not documented, instrumentation libraries SHOULD use applicable predefined value.

**[2] `gen_ai.system`:** The `gen_ai.system` describes a family of GenAI models with specific model identified
by `gen_ai.request.model` and `gen_ai.response.model` attributes.

The actual GenAI product may differ from the one identified by the client.
Multiple systems, including Azure OpenAI and Gemini, are accessible by OpenAI client
libraries. In such cases, the `gen_ai.system` is set to `openai` based on the
instrumentation's best knowledge, instead of the actual system. The `server.address`
attribute may help identify the actual system in use for `openai`.

For custom model, a custom friendly name SHOULD be used.
If none of these options apply, the `gen_ai.system` SHOULD be set to `_OTHER`.

**[3] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD match the error code returned by the Generative AI provider or the client library,
the canonical name of exception that occurred, or another low-cardinality error identifier.
Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

**[4] `gen_ai.conversation.id`:** Instrumentations SHOULD populate conversation id when they have it readily available
for a given operation, for example:

-  when client framework being instrumented manages conversation history
(see [LlamaIndex chat store](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/storing/chat_stores/))

- when instrumenting GenAI client libraries that maintain conversation on the backend side
(see [AWS Bedrock agent sessions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents-session-state.html),
[OpenAI Assistant threads](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/threads))

Application developers that manage conversation history MAY add conversation id to GenAI and other
spans or logs using custom span or log record processors or hooks provided by instrumentation
libraries.

**[5] `gen_ai.output.type`:** This attribute SHOULD be used when the client requests output of a specific type. The model may return zero or more outputs of this type.
This attribute specifies the output modality and not the actual output format. For example, if an image is requested, the actual output could be a URL pointing to an image file.
Additional output format details may be recorded in the future in the `gen_ai.output.{type}.*` attributes.

**[6] `gen_ai.output.type`:** when applicable and if the request includes an output format.

**[7] `gen_ai.request.model`:** The name of the GenAI model a request is being made to. If the model is supplied by a vendor, then the value must be the exact name of the model requested. If the model is a fine-tuned custom model, the value should have a more specific name than the base model that's been fine-tuned.

**[8] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[9] `gen_ai.input.messages_ref`:** This attribute records the reference to the content of
`gen_ai.input.messages` attribute when the content is too large or
contains sensitive information and should be stored separately from
general telemetry data.

Refer to the [Uploading content to external storage](/docs/gen-ai/gen-ai-spans.md#uploading-content-to-external-storage)
section for more details.

**[10] `gen_ai.output.messages_ref`:** This attribute records the reference to the content of
`gen_ai.output.messages` attribute when the content is too large or
contains sensitive information and should be stored separately from
general telemetry data.

Refer to the [Uploading content to external storage](/docs/gen-ai/gen-ai-spans.md#uploading-content-to-external-storage)
section for more details.

**[11] `gen_ai.response.model`:** If available. The name of the GenAI model that provided the response. If the model is supplied by a vendor, then the value must be the exact name of the model actually used. If the model is a fine-tuned custom model, the value should have a more specific name than the base model that's been fine-tuned.

**[12] `gen_ai.system.instructions_ref`:** This attribute records the reference to the content of `gen_ai.system.instructions` attribute when the content is too large or contains sensitive information and should be stored separately from general telemetry data.
Refer to the [Uploading content to external storage](/docs/gen-ai/gen-ai-spans.md#uploading-content-to-external-storage) section for more details.

**[13] `server.address`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[14] `gen_ai.input.messages`:** The system message/instructions are recorded separately in `gen_ai.system.instructions`.

Instrumentations MUST follow [Input messages JSON schema](/docs/gen-ai/gen-ai-input-messages.json).
When the attribute is recorded on events, it MUST be stored in structured
form. When recorded on spans, it SHOULD be stored as a JSON string,
unless a structured format is supported.

Messages MUST be provided in the order they were sent to the model or agent.
Instrumentations MAY provide a way for users to filter or truncate
input messages.

> [!Warning]
> This attribute is likely to contain sensitive information.

See [Recording content on attributes](/docs/gen-ai/gen-ai-spans.md#recording-content-on-attributes)
section for more details.

**[15] `gen_ai.output.messages`:** Instrumentations MUST follow [Output messages JSON schema](/docs/gen-ai/gen-ai-output-messages.json)
When the attribute is recorded on events, it MUST be stored in structured
form. When recorded on spans, it SHOULD be stored as a JSON string,
unless a structured format is supported.

Instrumentations MUST follow [System instructions JSON schema](/docs/gen-ai/gen-ai-system-instructions.json).
When the attribute is recorded on events, it MUST be stored in structured
form. When recorded on spans, it SHOULD be stored as a JSON string,
unless a structured format is supported.

However, it's common for tools to be executed by the application code. It's recommended
for the application developers to follow this semantic convention for tools invoked
by the application code.

**Span kind** SHOULD be `INTERNAL`.

**Span status** SHOULD follow the [Recording Errors](/docs/general/recording-errors.md) document.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`error.type`](/docs/registry/attributes/error.md) | string | Describes a class of error the operation ended with. [1] | `timeout`; `java.net.UnknownHostException`; `server_certificate_invalid`; `500` | `Conditionally Required` if the operation ended in an error | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`gen_ai.tool.call.id`](/docs/registry/attributes/gen-ai.md) | string | The tool call identifier. | `call_mszuSIzqtI65i1wAUOE8w5H4` | `Recommended` if available | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`gen_ai.tool.description`](/docs/registry/attributes/gen-ai.md) | string | The tool description. | `Multiply two numbers` | `Recommended` if available | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD match the error code returned by the Generative AI provider or the client library,
the canonical name of exception that occurred, or another low-cardinality error identifier.
Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

---

`error.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `_OTHER` | A fallback error value to be used when the instrumentation doesn't define a custom value. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |

## Capturing instructions, inputs, and outputs

### Full (buffered) content

Model instructions, user messages, and model outputs are considered sensitive and
are often large in size.

Recording large or sensitive content in telemetry may be problematic due to high
storage costs, regulatory requirements, or the need to enforce different access
models for operational and user data.

OpenTelemetry instrumentations SHOULD NOT capture them by default, but SHOULD
provide an option for users to opt in.

Application developers should choose an appropriate usage pattern based on
application needs and maturity:

1. [Default] Don't record instructions, inputs, or outputs.

2. Record instructions, inputs, and outputs on the GenAI spans using corresponding
   attributes (`gen_ai.system.instructions`, `gen_ai.input.messages`,
   `gen_ai.output.messages`).

   This approach is best suited for pre-production environments where telemetry
   volume is manageable and privacy regulations do not apply.

   See [Recording content on attributes](#recording-content-on-attributes)
   section for more details.

3. Store content externally and record references on the spans using:
   `gen_ai.system.instructions_ref`, `gen_ai.input.messages_ref`, and
   `gen_ai.output.messages_ref` attributes.

   This pattern is recommended for production environments where telemetry size
   is a concern or when handling sensitive data.

   See [Uploading content to external storage](#uploading-content-to-external-storage)
   section for more details.

#### Recording content on attributes

The content captured in `gen_ai.system.instructions`, `gen_ai.input.messages`,
and `gen_ai.output.messages` attributes is likely to be large.

It may contain media, and even in the text form, it may be lager than
observability backends limits for telemetry envelopes or attribute values.

The instructions, input and output messages attributes follow common structure
defined in [instructions JSON schema](./gen-ai-system-instructions.json),
[inputs JSON schema](./gen-ai-input-messages.json), and
[outputs JSON schema](./gen-ai-output-messages.json).

> [!NOTE]
>
> Recording structured attributes is currently only supported on events. This may
> change, check out [OTEP: Extending attributes to support complex values](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/pull/4485)
> for the details.

Until structured attributes are supported on spans, the corresponding attribute
value SHOULD be serialized to JSON string on spans (unless spans start supporting
complex attributes) and in their structured form on events.

Instrumentation MAY provide a configuration option allowing to truncate properties
such as individual message contents, preserving JSON structure.

#### Uploading content to external storage

Instrumentations MAY support user-defined in-process hooks to handle content upload.

The hook SHOULD operate independently of the opt-in flags that control capturing of
`gen_ai.system.instructions`, `gen_ai.input.messages`, and `gen_ai.output.messages`.

If such a hook is supported and configured, instrumentations SHOULD invoke it regardless
of the span sampling decision with:

- the instructions, [inputs](./gen-ai-input-messages.json), and
  [outputs](./gen-ai-output-messages.json) object using formats defined in this convention
  and before they are serialized to JSON string;
- the span instance

The hook implementation SHOULD be able to enrich and modify provided span, instructions,
and message objects.

If instrumentation is configured to also record `gen_ai.system.instructions`,
`gen_ai.input.messages`, and `gen_ai.output.messages` attributes, it SHOULD do it
after calling the hook and SHOULD record values that were potentially modified within
the hook implementation.

The hook API SHOULD be generic. The application or distro is responsible for the hook
implementation including

- the uploading process either in synchronous or asynchronous way,
- recording references to the uploaded content on the span,
- handling content in a different way.

Application or OpenTelemetry distributions MAY also implement content uploading
in the telemetry processing pipeline (in-process or via a collector), based on the
`gen_ai.system.instructions`, `gen_ai.input.messages`, and `gen_ai.output.messages`
attributes. Given the potential data volume, it is RECOMMENDED to tune batching
and export settings accordingly in the OpenTelemetry SDK pipeline.
