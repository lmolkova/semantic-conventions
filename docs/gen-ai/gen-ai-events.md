# Semantic conventions for generative AI events

**Status**: [Development][DocumentStatus]

GenAI instrumentations MAY capture user inputs sent to the model and responses received from it as [events](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/v1.45.0/specification/logs/data-model.md#events).

> Note:
> Events are in-development and not yet available in some languages. Check [spec-compliance matrix](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/v1.45.0/spec-compliance-matrix.md#logs) to see the implementation status in corresponding language.

Instrumentations MAY capture inputs and outputs if and only if application has enabled the collection of this data.
This is for three primary reasons:

1. Data privacy concerns. End users of GenAI applications may input sensitive information or personally identifiable information (PII) that they do not wish to be sent to a telemetry backend.
2. Data size concerns. Although there is no specified limit to sizes, there are practical limitations in programming languages and telemetry systems. Some GenAI systems allow for extremely large context windows that end users may take full advantage of.
3. Performance concerns. Sending large amounts of data to a telemetry backend may cause performance issues for the application.

Body fields that contain user input, model output, or other potentially sensitive and verbose data
SHOULD NOT be captured by default.

Semantic conventions for individual systems which extend content events SHOULD document all additional body fields and specify whether they
should be captured by default or need application to opt into capturing them.

Telemetry consumers SHOULD expect to receive unknown body fields.

Instrumentations SHOULD NOT capture undocumented body fields and MUST follow the documented defaults for known fields.
Instrumentations MAY offer configuration options allowing to disable events or allowing to capture all fields.

## Event: `gen_ai.inputs`

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

The event name MUST be `gen_ai.inputs`.

This event represents the whole input to the GenAI model in the model-specific format.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`gen_ai.system`](/docs/registry/attributes/gen-ai.md) | string | The Generative AI product as identified by the client or server instrumentation. [1] | `openai` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1] `gen_ai.system`:** The `gen_ai.system` describes a family of GenAI models with specific model identified
by `gen_ai.request.model` and `gen_ai.response.model` attributes.

The actual GenAI product may differ from the one identified by the client.
Multiple systems, including Azure OpenAI and Gemini, are accessible by OpenAI client
libraries. In such cases, the `gen_ai.system` is set to `openai` based on the
instrumentation's best knowledge, instead of the actual system. The `server.address`
attribute may help identify the actual system in use for `openai`.

For custom model, a custom friendly name SHOULD be used.
If none of these options apply, the `gen_ai.system` SHOULD be set to `_OTHER`.

`gen_ai.system` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.
