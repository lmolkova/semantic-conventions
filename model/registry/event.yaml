          Identifies the class / type of event.
        note: |
          Event names are subject to the same rules as [attribute names](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-naming/).
          Notably, event names are namespaced to avoid collisions and provide a clean
          separation of semantics for events in separate domains like browser, mobile, and
          kubernetes.

          Events with the same `event.name` are structurally similar to one another.

          When recording events from an existing system as OpenTelemetry Events, it is
          possible that the existing system does not have the equivalent of a name or
          requires multiple fields to identify the structure of the events. In such cases,
          OpenTelemetry recommends using a combination of one or more fields as the name
          such that the name identifies the event structurally. It is also recommended that
          the event names have low-cardinality, so care must be taken to use fields
          that identify the class of Events but not the instance of the Event.

        note: >
          The `event.data` MAY be used only on Span Events to capture the event payload (body) and MUST NOT be used
          on `LogRecord`s or `Event`s.
