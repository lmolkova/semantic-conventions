          It's REQUIRED to document error types instrumentation produces.
          It's RECOMMENDED to use a connection error code if it's provided by the socket library, runtime, or the OS
          (such as `connect` method error code on [Linux or other POSIX systems](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/connect.2.html#ERRORS) /
          [Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-connect#return-value)).
