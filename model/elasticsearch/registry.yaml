    attributes:

        brief: >
          Represents the human-readable identifier of the node/instance to which a request was routed.

        brief: >
          A dynamic value in the url path.
        note: >
          Many Elasticsearch url paths allow dynamic values. These SHOULD be recorded in span attributes in the format
          `elasticsearch.path_parts.<key>`, where `<key>` is the url path part name. The implementation SHOULD
          reference the [elasticsearch schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elastic/elasticsearch-specification/main/output/schema/schema.json)
          in order to map the path part values to their names.
        examples:
          [
            "elasticsearch.path_parts.index=test-index",
            "elasticsearch.path_parts.doc_id=123",
          ]
