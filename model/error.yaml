        note: |
          The `error.id` SHOULD be predictable and SHOULD have low cardinality.
          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

          The cardinality of `error.id`` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low, but
          telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
          should be prepared for `error.id` to have high cardinality at query time, when no
          additional filters are applied.

          If operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.id`.
          Telemetry consumers SHOULD treat absence of `error.id` and empty `error.id` the same
          (as an indication that operation did not fail).

          If a specific domain defines its own set of error codes (such as HTTP or gRPC status codes),
          it's RECOMMENDED to use a domain-specific attribute and also set `error.id` to capture
          all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.
