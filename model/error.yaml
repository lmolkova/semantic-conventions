    brief: >
      This document defines the shared attributes used to
      report an error.
    attributes:
      - id: id
        brief: 'Describes a class of error the operation ended with.'
        type:
          allow_custom_values: true
          members:
            - id: other
              value: "_OTHER"
              brief: 'A fallback error value to be used when the instrumentation does not define a custom value for it.'
        examples: ['timeout', 'java.net.UnknownHostException', 'server_certificate_invalid', 'Internal Server Error']
        note: |
          The `error.id` SHOULD be predictable and SHOULD have low cardinality.
          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

          The cardinality of `error.id` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low, but
          telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
          should be prepared for `error.id` to have high cardinality at query time, when no
          additional filters are applied.

          If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.id`.

          If a specific domain defines its own set of error codes (such as HTTP or gRPC status codes),
          it's RECOMMENDED to use a domain-specific attribute and also set `error.id` to capture
          all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.
