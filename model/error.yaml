    brief: >
      This document defines the shared attributes used to
      report an error.
    attributes:
      - id: description
        brief: 'Describes a class of error that operation ended with.'
        type:
          allow_custom_values: true
          members:
            - id: empty
              value: ""
              brief: 'No error. Default value.'
            - id: other
              value: "_OTHER"
              brief: 'Any error reason instrumentation does not define custom value for.'
        examples: ['timeout', 'java.net.UnknownHostException', 'server_certificate_invalid', 'Internal Server Error']
        note: |
          The error description SHOULD be predictable and SHOULD have low cardinality.
          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

          The cardinality of error description within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low, but
          telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
          should be prepared for `error.description` to have high cardinality at query time, when no
          additional filters are applied.

          If operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.description`.

          If a specific domain defines its own set of error codes (such as HTTP or gRPC status codes),
          it's RECOMMENDED to use a domain-specific attribute and also set `error.description` to capture
          all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.
