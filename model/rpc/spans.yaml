          instrumentations SHOULD NOT do a reverse proxy lookup to obtain DNS name and SHOULD set
          `server.address` to the IP address provided in the host component.

      This span represents an outgoing Remote Procedure (RPC) call.

      Remote procedure calls can only be represented with these semantic conventions,
      when the names of the called service and method are known and available.

      Refer to the [Span Name](#span-name) section for details on naming spans.

      In the lifetime of an RPC stream, an event for each message sent/received on
      client and server spans SHOULD be created. In case of unary calls only one sent
      and one received message will be recorded for both client and server spans.
