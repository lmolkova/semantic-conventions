      This span represents AWS Lambda invocation.
    note: |
      For all events, a span with kind `SERVER` MUST be created corresponding to the function invocation unless stated
      otherwise below.

      Unless stated otherwise below, the name of the span MUST be set to the function name from the
      Lambda `Context`.

      Consider setting other attributes of the [`faas` resource][faasres] and [trace][faas] conventions
      and the [cloud resource conventions][cloud].
