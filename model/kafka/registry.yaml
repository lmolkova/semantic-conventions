          Message keys in Kafka are used for grouping alike messages to ensure they're processed on the same partition.
          They differ from `messaging.message.id` in that they're not unique.
          If the key is `null`, the attribute MUST NOT be set.
        note: >
          If the key type is not string, it's string representation has to be supplied for the attribute.
          If the key has no unambiguous, canonical string form, don't include its value.
        examples: 'myKey'
